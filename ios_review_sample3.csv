953,I am an Rv sales rep and I survive in the down time by repeat customers and referrals. I have learned the importance of remembering people at a personal level and how well people respond to a person who takes the time to remember their name and important facts about them. This app does all that for me and more. One downside that I see is in order to maintain my customers I think I may have to spend $9.99 per month. I wish there was more of a tutorial on how to. I love the concept. Love the app only had it for a day so far and it has already helped tremendously. Thank you,US,2014-11-23 02:03:00,5,Ppmortensen,Wow what a great app,588871560,

957,The interface is user friendly upon first picking it up but other than just data entry\, like any CRM\, there is a learning curve with functionality.It's best used with an iPhone AND and iPad. The iPhone screen is too small to stare at all day and the iPad can't make phone calls. But\, if you have both devices\, it's a great app. The Bluetooth pairing may require some finagling at times (or patience) but overall it's pretty easy to use.Some requests:- app can store files per account (yay) but only integrates with iCloud. Would like to see integration with Microsoft's OneDrive in a future update.- email integration uses Apple API which has pros and cons. Would love to see a native email app that can track messages per account\, insert files directly and send to multiple recipients all from within the app.Thanks for reading!,US,2014-10-15 14:38:00,4,Daryle H.,Great CRM App- best used w/ iPhone AND an iPad,588871560,
958,I have been searching for a good mobile CRM for several years. I have tried just about every app out there\, including paid services like Salesforce. I found Salesmesh (previously Appmesh) a couple of years ago. At that time\, it was a good app\, but it was in its infancy and didn't do everything I needed. Nonetheless\, I kept it on my iphone and checked it when I noticed updates. Three months ago\, I was again frustrated with the CRM I was using (Salesforce) and decided to look at Salesmesh again. I was pleasantly surprised by the transformation of the app and decided to give it another try. I have not looked back since. Salesmesh is\, without question\, the best free CRM on iOS and it continues to get better. The only reason I cannot give it five stars is because\, at this time\, Salesmesh is only accessible on iOS. If you are without your iPhone/iPad\, there is no way to access your data. This will easily be a five star app when they enable web browser access. That being said\, I highly recommend this app to anyone in outside sales. You will not find a better way to track your customers\, deals\, and activity.,US,2014-10-04 15:27:00,4,paycheck44,The Best Free CRM - And Now Works with iOS 8!,588871560,
959,I've been using this app for a month or so and love it.   Very simple to use and pretty intuitive with a beautiful interface.   I've emailed customer service a couple times either with questions or to solve a deli a I had and always got responses back within an hour!   That is impressive- even for a smaller company.  Thanks for creating this app and helping me organize my sales records!!,US,2014-09-30 13:54:00,5,mtgroseth,Wonderful app and awesome customer service,588871560,

972,My husband and I thought this was a great app for our renovations business. It was great to keep track of clients\, estimates\, employees and schedules. There were a few minor glitches like not being able to move back and forth between the calendar and contacts. There is a black line that appears periodically covering those buttons. But overall we were happy. However\, now I can't log into the app on my phone and input or see data. It just spins.  All other apps are working on my phone. If the bugs are fixed this could be a great app!,US,2014-05-23 12:22:00,3,kimtexashouse,Can't get the app to load anymore!,588871560,

975,From the interface\, this looks like the small business CRM I've been dreaming of. It seems to track deals\, people\, organizations\, tasks\, and follow up. Unfortunately\, it hung forever trying to let me import from my 3\,000-person contact list. Deleting\, reinstalling\, and retrying four or five times\, and I finally got it to load my address book and import a few contacts. Tonight I was simply trying to read the help file and work my way through the interface\, and just reading help caused to app to crash consistently. Summary: once it works\, it might be a pretty awesome app.,US,2014-04-17 02:12:00,2,Stever777,Great design\, extremely buggy,588871560,

We do not work out the same office\, we don't even always go in the office everyday\, so this is great to find out if something has been rented before we make the trip all the way over to the property.,US,2014-03-26 05:28:00,5,Ang31677,Love it!,588871560,
979,This is by far the most useful CRM I’ve found without having to be enrolled in Salesforce\, etc.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who’s looking for a simple yet thorough CRM to keep them up to date and greatly organized on opportunities\, emails\, conversations\, etc.  In addition\, the customer support is outstanding and willing to listen to your comments and suggestions to improve the product\, which I expect will become even more useful as they incorporate user input.  These guys (and gals) are definitely on the right track and have tapped into a CRM for the salesperson\, and not just management.

I've been in technology sales for over 17 years\, and I've launched my own speaking and training business\, which means a lot of cold calls\, and a lot of necessary activity tracking demands.SalesMesh has delivered with flying colors.The app allows me to track all activities with eases\, to associate any kind of interaction with users\, companies\, or deals\, and to communicate seamlessly and record those conversations.I can launch emails or phone calls right from the app\, and there's a record. The app is very stable\, and the support is outstanding.I look forward to the next release which will allow greater sync options between the app and the iOS calendar.

I had a problem with receiving my forwarded emails\, I emailed support and within an hour I received a reply with instructions on how to solve the problem. It turned out to be me.

990,Importing doesn't work right now. I have to manually type in contacts info which means that before I can really see what this app can do I'll have to spend most of my time typing instead of working. Maybe I can just put only new clients in.,US,2013-12-15 12:37:00,3,@davessuccess,Interesting app but doesn't seem to be finished,588871560,

992,I have been looking for a CRM that was even remotely useful\, in hopes that maybe ill stumble upon the perfect app later on down the road.Fortunately I spent a little time messing around with appmesh and I have to say I'm blown away. Especially because there is no reviews yet! They have it right from the beginning and that makes all the difference to me.,US,2013-12-05 21:19:00,5,Mattymoe94,Simply amazing,588871560,

994,It was great at first.  I linked all of my contacts\, etc.  After update to iOS7\, it won't open\, won't let me login.  Support was very friendly\, but absolutely unable to help - fishy to me.  There is no online portal to manage your account.  Beware!!  So\, my data is out in the webo-sphere\, and I have an app that I cannot use.  Apple?

998,For an app that is less than a year old\, its pretty good.  I would like to seethe ability to attach documents to contacts or businesses (things like proposals or quarterly statements).  You can add pictures to contact but you can't upload them for your camera roll which I think is very strange.  It would also be great if there was a map section to map out all your accounts like I've seen on other CRM apps.Overall thought\, its very good and I hope to see the\, continue to improve.,US,2013-08-11 22:51:00,4,OBixo,Good overall\, needs some improvements,588871560,

1002,I've been a Salesforce subscriber for a few years now and never really liked it..but they are the big name in crm so I went with them.  SO happy I found this app before my Salesforce subscription renewed. :)  They have way better user interface\, much easier to navigate and just really intuitive....and the few times I have noticed room for improvement\, I've emailed the developers and they've been super responsive to feedback to improve the app further.  Looking forward to this app living a long life because I haven't seen another crm program that's even close to this one.  <3,US,2013-06-20 02:23:00,5,Uber happy user,GREAT crm app and interface,588871560,

1006,I tried this app after seeing a WSJ article on it.If there was a way to give zero stars\, this app would have gotten that rating.The app opens to require you to input your email address.  It then says something snarky (perhaps they should spend time writing better code instead of trying to be funny).After crashing multiple times while trying to verify the email address\, upon the third retry\, it started telling me that I did not have an internet connection.  Completely false... Safari was connecting just fine.Tried to reach support via the button.  Takes you to a website where there is NO support\, but at least there is a Jobs button.Uninstalled and reinstalled the app\, I was then able to get through the registration process.... but then it continuously crashed when the agenda page came up.Experience was similar on my iPad 3 and my iPhone 5\, so it is not the device.Bottom line... stay away!!!,US,2013-04-09 19:30:00,1,Batmanii,Horrible app.  No support,588871560,

2764,Wow\, this was five stars worthy for awhile. Told a ton of friends about it and everything and then POOF! They do an update and suddenly everything is a package from $1.99-$24.99\, and all of the good images/stickers are gone\, or not worth the money. I rarely write reviews\, but how else am I supposed to tell you guys at Photofy that your new update is SO disappointing and I'll no longer bother referring people to your app or using you myself. Way to sell out guys\, way to sell out...,US,2014-08-27 03:57:00,1,AStarkkk,This went downhill FAST,674208785,

2787,I have not written a review in a long time however this app is deserving of my time to write it. I discovered this app when a friend of mine posted a photo she had made using Photofy. It said something along the lines of whatever you do in life be sure it makes you happy.  I love the saying and the picture she created. I have to admit I use a different app called Collage to put multiple pictures together and save it to my camera roll and then select that picture to open in Photofy. It seems like a lengthy process but the collages I post make for my friends and family are absolutely awesome. It took a little time to fully learn how to use this app… Okay a full Sunday afternoon ... But it's wonderful,US,2014-08-20 00:33:00,5,Amy12477,Best photo app in yeArs,674208785,
2788,If ure looking for stickers for your pics this app has them ... I just love it :D,US,2014-08-19 23:56:00,5,Svc26,Love it,674208785,
2789,I would give it a full 5 stars but I started a project and completely lost it.,US,2014-08-19 19:08:00,4,Shantana22,Rating,674208785,
2790,I really like this app cause I can add already made sayings to a picture. My grand daughter birthday is coming up and instead of typing happy birthday out\, there is some really cute ones to add to pic plus you can change color and different way it's written out.   Of course you can purchase more sayings. Great app!,US,2014-08-19 13:40:00,5,Ccrs1,Great app!,674208785,
2791,I was very impressed by the big selection for customization. Was a little disappointed when it cost .99 cents to remove the watermark but payed it anyways because that's how the app makes money. But was most disappointed that when my picture saved\, the resolution was much lower than the original photo used causing the picture to not be clear. So I spent a lot of time on the picture\, payed to remove the watermark and received a not clear photo.,US,2014-08-19 05:58:00,3,Jackie3313,Fun but low quality resolution,674208785,
2792,Updated Review 08/18/14: still no improvement in resolution.  What a shame\, such a beautiful app.  Such a disappointment.Original Review:  The app has great functionality\, is feature rich\, but saves at a miserable 1mp (1000x1000). Just enough resolution for social media.  There are much better apps out there that collage at high/printable resolutions and add text overlay apps that save at full resolution of the original image.  This one would be a contender if the developer ups it's game on the saved resolution.,US,2014-08-19 02:14:00,3,Techno-nut,Sophisticated\, full featured\, but lacking in Resolution,674208785,

2797,I love this app. Love the features. Love all the options. Wish you could pay for everything at once rather than buying 400 different mini packages. WHY DOES IT KEEP CRASHING THOUGH??? I'm most of the way done making something and it crashes. It doesn't save what I was doing so I start all over and then it does it over and over again. SOOOO FRUSTRATING!!! I'm gonna have to find a different app to use until this one is fixed. ,US,2014-08-17 02:11:00,2,Love2bake22,WHY DOES IT KEEP CRASHING?!?!,674208785,

2965,Initially\, I was really excited about Photofy—but not too long after I realized that in order to do any customization\, I better get used to hitting 'locked' roadblocks (getting access to the color wheel\, for example\, costs .99). I purchased access to Photofy Premium thinking it would unlock enough stickers to cover what I'd use it for—then found after my first search\, the sticker I chose was not only locked\, but had the Photofy watermark on it which really takes away from the photo.The constant charges are annoying\, but if you find the app useful\, I guess it's worth it. I'm just not sold on it yet.,US,2014-05-12 00:10:00,3,StripedPaisley,Has potential\, but not quite there yet,674208785,

2974,I LOVED this app until the new update. I used it to make flyers and other promotional images for an organization at my university using the background option. Now that it is gone\, I have little use for this app and will quite possibly uninstall it and look for something that can better fulfill my needs.,US,2014-04-24 15:50:00,3,CaseFace ,New Update,674208785,

2987,3 stars because I have yet to be able to finalize a single photo. Every time I hit 'preview' the app crashes and I have to restart. However\, the app has a lot of options and I love the concept. I just hope they fix the crashing aspect so I'm able to use it.,US,2014-04-05 22:04:00,3,Drivers84,Keeps Crashing...,674208785,

2992,The app has several options for photo additions to jazz them up. Although there are additional purchases that I did in order to obtain the other options\, it was worth it (I've paid more for less on other apps). The app is easy to use and very useful if you plan on editing your own pics without Photoshop. I'm completely hooked! Large variation for a couple bucks is alright with me!,US,2014-03-31 03:41:00,5,Karlotta411,Fun!!,674208785,

2998,I've downloaded a few photo apps & love them all but there's always that one element missing that you wish wasn't. The reason I give 4 stars is because it takes longer than I'd like for each filter to 'render' otherwise I LOVEEEE!!! P.S.

3004,I like the features on this app but every time I finish editing and hit preview\, it crashes and I lose all my work. So far\, I've only had one finished photo that worked for me. Disappointing!,US,2014-03-09 13:43:00,2,Nikimowse,Cool App Until...,674208785,
3005,The moment I downloaded this app I fell in love! It's one of a kind. Yea some things are locked\, but compared to what other non premium apps offer photofy already gives you quite the selection. I have no complaints at all in fact this app has gone beyond just decorating my pictures or thoughts its help me realize my true passion for graphic design\, typography\, and etc. my future in graphic design and so on has become alot clearer since the moment I opened the app. Love Love Love photofy! -KELSIE,US,2014-03-03 09:02:00,5,Sellerpro,The best typography app,674208785,

3010,Way too many in-app purchases.  You will be $1.99ed to death.  Just be honest and say that the price is xxxx\, and don't force the customer to constantly have to give you more money.  I don't really have a problem with in-app purchases\, however\, this is overkill!,US,2014-02-19 18:46:00,2,iTunesfool,By the time you add up all the IAP's it costs way too much.,674208785,
3011,Love this app but annoyed that to most of the good features require payment to unlock. Plus you can't just unlock one thing you are paying for a designer's series. What happens if you only like a few things? It's not realistic to charge $1.99 every time to unlock a feature. Not worth the money and what a pain. This app can get costly quickly.,US,2014-02-15 21:39:00,4,Sassymomchicago,Great but,674208785,
3012,This app is definitely one of my most favorite photo apps!!! I love being about to all amazing and sometimes goofy little things to my photos!!! And I absolutely love the new updates!!

3014,I would use this app more except it crashes frequently or just shows a black screen where the image should be. Also\, offer a one-time price for ALL the artwork like other apps of this kind do.

3269,I have used this app to send personalized postcards to my folks. It's great because you can choose lots of collage shapes and so I could use photos of all 4 of my kids on the one card.

3378,Worked perfectly! As soon as I put my iPad in flight mode\, I turned on wifi in the settings and connected to the Southwest wifi. Then I opened the app and it took me to  their page where I paid. As soon as it processed I was online. The connection was a little slow for a photo heavy app like Pinterest but I'm not complaining. I was very happy to be able to pass some time online while in flight.,US,2014-12-29 21:39:00,5,Katerina Holm,Worked perfectly!,841069888,

3385,I would love it if I didn't need this app\, but Southwest makes you use it to watch video in-flight\, so here I am. Free TV works fine\, haven't used it to watch anything you need to pay for\, and probably won't.,US,2014-12-14 05:57:00,3,Insomniac81,Gets the job done,841069888,
3386,Very buggy.... don't try to download it while you are on the plane. When you play shows it works but sometimes some shows will not. Today I was able to watch 'Two Broke Girls' but not 'Big Bang'.. not the first time this has happen....,US,2014-12-11 21:39:00,2,Uncle Fester LV,buggy,841069888,
3387,I used this last week during a 2 hour flight to Atlanta and also on the return flight. It made the flight so much better. Unlike some of the other reviewer it worked the entire 2 hours without having to buffer or reload the page.  Totally enjoyed it,US,2014-12-07 01:21:00,5,Caribbean-Queen,Wonderful,841069888,
3388,took the trouble to download it\, error message 'your device does not support digital playback.'it is an iPhone\, dummy\, that is running your app.stupid,US,2014-12-05 16:12:00,1,Soundman245,waste,841069888,
3389,Flight from S. California to N. CAlifornia and this app only worked maybe 4minutes during this flight!,US,2014-12-05 06:23:00,1,Neeman.,Doesn't work!,841069888,
3390,Horrible horrible app. It froze constantly and told me my movie had ended half way through my viewing. The player was so stupid I never got to finish my movie which is extremely infuriating. Do not waste your $5!,US,2014-12-03 07:19:00,1,Tbh,Waste of money,841069888,
3391,Terrible experience on Southwest yesterday. I took the time to download this\, based on their false advertising. It did not work at all. Not clear what the app even does since this is an entirely browser-based service. I couldn't get live or on-demand TV to work at all. I couldn't even load a list of movies to buy (probably a good thing based on other reviews of it cutting off). Only the flight tracking worked. Utterly useless and a total waste of time. Class-action lawsuit for false-advertising\, anyone?,US,2014-12-02 12:03:00,1,kelvins,Awful. Does not work.,841069888,
3392,It's been broken for a month. I have to remove the app\, reinstall it every flight. What gives?,US,2014-12-01 23:34:00,1,JasonHood,Southwest Do Something,841069888,
3393,Used it during recent Southwest flight and was extremely disappointed! It froze/pixilated constantly. Failed to load tv shows 50% of the time...it worked but poorly and barely. Great idea. Dismal application.,US,2014-12-01 02:17:00,2,PricklyPear7,Very buggy,841069888,
3394,This app is pure GARBAGE.  These guys should be sued for all the money they have duped people out of.   Just like everyone else\, couldn't finish a movie.  Couldn't pause\, fast forward.  I would have rated negative if it was possible.,US,2014-11-30 15:38:00,1,Jca12328363534,TERRIBLE,841069888,
3395,Ok\, I seriously question the 5 star reviews. It wouldn't work properly and for those sitting around me on both flights couldn't get it to work. It would have been better if this wasn't offered because you spend the first hour or so trying to get it to work\, the next hour or so troubleshooting\, and the last hour being annoyed you wasted so much time and effort. Just don't.,US,2014-11-30 04:02:00,1,Coahlb,Ugh. Horrible.,841069888,
3396,This App worked fine. Used on a flight from Charleston to Baltimore. I would recommend downloading the App prior to your trip. HGTV was the channel I watched...if that matters.,US,2014-11-29 19:11:00,4,Acer rubrum,Watched TV,841069888,
3397,Spent 30 minutes deleting and reinstalling because the app kept freezing. Then I realized it wasn't me it's the app/wifi. Might be a band width issue idk but save your time and money\, it's total junk.,US,2014-11-27 16:21:00,1,Prussbus,Total Junk,841069888,
3398,Constantly stops streaming\, picks up at a different place from where you left off. One of the most bug ridden\, poorly executed apps I have used to date.,US,2014-11-26 19:49:00,1,JBKonis,Unfinished\, worse than beta,841069888,
3399,Read all the 1 star reviews before you consider wasting money on an in-flight movie on Southwest. This is the most infuriating software I've ever used.Short summary is that you can't skip\, scrub\, or rewind\, and it randomly decides to stop playing your movie whenever it wants. After it crashes\, there's no way to resume where you left off.Read a book\, or do literally anything else\, to save yourself the frustration.,US,2014-11-26 17:53:00,1,tomocchino,5 star reviews are lying.. This app is horrible.,841069888,

3401,All this app does is open Safari and take you to a website that you are normally forced to visit when you try to go online anyway. I wonder why they felt the need to make this?Don't bother downloading this\, just open a browser on any device and try to go online. It is literally the same page. This app actually adds a few steps to this flow\, so it is arguably worse using this than nothing at all.,US,2014-11-21 03:29:00,1,Kerning1,Worthless app,841069888,
3402,I purchased “The Ender’s Game\,” and was able to watch about 45 minutes of it before I was cut off by the Onboard Player app. I was unable to continue watching my movie\, and the stewardess said that she didn’t know how to resolve this either. She added that this issue is common. I was charged $5.00 to watch less than half a movie. Totally disappointed.,US,2014-11-18 06:48:00,1,DontBuyMovie,Simply Trash...,841069888,
3403,This is the most frustrating app I've ever had to deal with.  I am an A List'er and this is ridiculous. Stopped and would not restart or had to start the movie all over again.,US,2014-11-17 20:43:00,1,Jayjay yaya,Worst app ever,841069888,
3404,If you pause the app will not let you go back to the same point. This is especially frustrating when trying to resume after a connection. Also\, none of the full movies will allow you to see the end of the movie. Some will even stop halfway through and indicate that the movie is over. Horrible experience! I fly SWA enough to have a companion and now I have a terrible taste in my mouth.,US,2014-11-12 00:27:00,1,Ellisstate,Don't buy movie! Southwest movies will not finish,841069888,
3405,I won't use this app again.  We bought two movies that both dropped out towards the end of our movies about 30 minutes to the end.  The app told us they were over.  We restarted them but could not get to the point were left off.  We go the just of what happened but we did not see the either movie in its entirety.  Don't bother with this app.,US,2014-11-10 20:08:00,1,johnny80s,Dropped out at the end of both movies,841069888,
3406,Easy to use app that worked flawlessly the entire flight.,US,2014-11-10 03:36:00,5,der Dummkopf,Works as Advertised,841069888,
3407,Repeatedly shut my movies down early *halfway through two films*. Would not let me easily scrub the location to where it dropped me\, and when it did\, it would either freeze or end early again. Absolutely terrible\, and I'll be contacting SWA for a refund.,US,2014-11-08 23:40:00,1,westbaymonument,Extremely disappointing.,841069888,
3408,I get the Southwest Airlines inflight portal up. I click tv. I choose a channel. The webpage flashes and then nothing happens. I choose a different channel. Webpage flashes and nothing happens. I have a feeling that it's trying to launch this player app but can't. And since no one will support it\, you're screwed. It does work though. I see people around me enjoying tv. Just not me.,US,2014-11-07 02:27:00,1,Skipjacker68,Doesn't work and there's no support,841069888,
3409,Purchased movie & wifi (to load onboard player app) on southwest flight. Could not access movie or netflix as promised.  $13 down the drain :(,US,2014-11-06 14:38:00,1,Bllllll,Scam,841069888,
3410,I downloaded this app for a recent trip on Southwest Airlines.  The 'player' would work for maybe 10-15 seconds before it freeze.  Almost like it was buffering\, except it never recovered or resumed playing. So I had to kill it to try again... Same results.  Bottom line\, very disappointed in the App & Southwest for forcing its use.  In the past\, I've been able to watch the Dish content with a browser with no problems.Don't waste your time with this useless ap!,US,2014-10-27 15:53:00,1,Regatta Network,Total waste of time,841069888,

3412,I bought a movie and 30 mins from the end the player stated that the movie had ended.  No other option then to start the movie over.  Slide bar does not advance movie more than 2 minutes so you either have to skip 2 mins ahead or re-watch.  Then at the same point at the movie\, player once again states that the movie had ended.  Don't waste your time.,US,2014-10-23 14:45:00,1,esporama,Too unpredictable,841069888,
3413,What an amazing app!  This is a must-have for southwest airline flyers!  I watched a Thursday night football game\, a mlb playoff game and episodes of the Big Bang theory all on my flight with a perfect\, smooth wifi connection.  Simply amazing!,US,2014-10-22 02:00:00,5,edswvumounties11,Must-have App,841069888,
3414,Installed &fused this app on recent Southwest flight from Orlando to Manchester\, NH. It worked immediately and perfectly throughout the flight. It must have worked for others as it was Thursday Night Football - there were cheers throughout the plane when teams made touchdowns!,US,2014-10-19 21:27:00,5,LadyRoseCTFan,Did Its Job,841069888,
3415,I purchased an in-flight movie easily enough.  The movie played\, however when I had to pause the movie the player jumped back to the beginning and the slider bar had to be held to where you left off\, and maybe it might go back there.  I also get 10 minutes from the end and a screen pops up that says my movie was over......REALLY?  I would not use this again unless I had to.,US,2014-10-17 18:59:00,1,GWSpirate,Don't stop or pause the movie.,841069888,
3416,This was just dreadful. I bought the wifi on a southwest flight so that I could watch Netflix (which they advertised could be watched on their wifi)\, but every time I tried to log in\, southwest continually redirected me to an 'Oops we strayed you off course!' Web page. So I decided to download this video player app so that I could at least watch something. After waiting 45 minutes for it to load\, because the wifi on this flight is abysmally slow\, it told me repeatedly that 'the app could not be downloaded at this time'. This was a waste of time and a waste of money. Learn from my mistake!,US,2014-10-13 18:43:00,1,Jdkdnssldngekdnd,It's a Trap,841069888,
3417,Don't bother trying to download this on your flight In order to watch a movie. The wifi on Southwest is too slow to support it. Not worth it,US,2014-10-10 15:48:00,1,U.Nowen,Terrible,841069888,

3419,This review is not about how easy or hard it is to use. It is about the usability and functionality. Given what people are used to in terms of a video streaming experience this application does falls well below expectations!  The movie stopped twice saying that my video had ended. It had nothing!  The app stopped working. Even when trying to resume video the movie was restarted from beginning. Tried to fast forward but the app would not allow me to get to a point where I could resume. I after numerous tries I could only either restart or move to a point past where the movie stopped. This app needs serious attention!,US,2014-09-30 14:08:00,1,Armando Siliceo,Not ready for prime time!,841069888,
3420,I bought wifi inflight because the southwest website said it was necessary to get this app and I was not aware of it preflight. However\, after the purchase all it did was launch the southwest/dish web page but nothing would actually play. I finally watched the commercial and at the end there is an option to 'skip and watch tv' at the bottom right of the video. Only then could I watch tv and it loaded right in the browser. This method worked on all the rest of our apple devices without this app\,and sized the video just fine.,US,2014-09-27 16:59:00,1,Jennfir,Not worth it,841069888,
3421,this software seriously lacks in decent http protocol and streaming. It also has long loading time and scrubbing isn't accurate.,US,2014-09-17 01:28:00,1,Andy Zimmerman,Poor coding,841069888,
3422,This app is very cool. It comes to life when you're in the plane and not before. I enjoyed seeing our flight speed\, altitude and ETA. Also able to see current weather at destination\, current geographical flight path\, and flight connection status. On top of that are direct TV movies\, free tv channels and lists of episodes of top shows. I really enjoyed this app it was a nice surprise. Installed on ipad and iphone.,US,2014-09-07 19:30:00,5,Checkbookcaptain,Really cool.,841069888,

3424,I downloaded this app to buy and watch movies while in flight\, but as soon as I downloaded it both movies and tv shows onDemand stopped showing up on the entertainment portal. Is this something I am doing wrong\, or did the act of downloading this app really prohibit me from buying and watching movies? That wouldn't make much sense!,US,2014-08-26 00:36:00,1,Cherrollz,Confused,841069888,
3425,This app has the right idea and thing going for them but the playback and pause/rewind/fast-forward features have enough trouble I'm not sure it was worth it.,US,2014-08-24 21:27:00,1,Brepas92,Not impressed,841069888,
3426,TV listings have no obvious way to start playing the show.  I clicked everywhere and nothing worked.  Scrolling to the channel you want is almost impossible because it keeps moving after you stop swiping.,US,2014-08-23 16:25:00,1,jrhiris,Doesn't work in any way,841069888,

3431,I would rate this zero stars if I could. This app gives you wifi just so you can pay for it. This app is a complete waste. You have to pay 10 dollars for wifi,US,2014-08-02 18:16:00,1,Zoey h.,Terrible app,841069888,
3432,This lousy app can't even properly rewind or jump forward on a video.  It stalls or simply refuses to go to the proper time.  I only downloaded to see the Simpsons on a flight.   He default player on the airline works fine\, I can rewind or forward the videos accurately.   Very lame,US,2014-07-24 13:44:00,1,RSinAustin,Very poor product,841069888,
3433,Horrible player. The biggest problem is that\, if you are interrupted during playback\, you cannot go back to where you left off. Sometimes it jumps to a random spot way ahead\, or mostly it just starts over. Very frustrating. But of course there's no alternative for watching movies during flight. Unless you skip it and bring your own\, which is what I'll be doing in the future. Avoid if possible.,US,2014-07-23 04:41:00,1,JLJAS,There really needs to be a better player option,841069888,

3435,I swear most of the review writers know squat about tech. Yes\, you can log into Safari and see the same things\, however\, this app recognizes your mobile device and makes the website fit into your mobile screen. Going through Safari on your mobile gives you the full laptop website and it's difficult to maneuver in from your device. Yes\, they ask for an email\, put a fake email in dumb dumb\, problem solved. Nonetheless\, great app\, there is tons of TV shows you can view that makes it easier to pass the time.,US,2014-07-14 08:04:00,5,SergGianoni,Just download it,841069888,

3438,The app is for unlocking certain tv shows digital rights protection like how I met your mother from the on demand section and movies.  It is not to watch the live tv portion of the southwest portal you can do that through the browser already.  Think of it as a codec for digital protection\, it runs in the background. Maybe some of the reviewers should read what the purpose of the app is before trashing it and looking like complete idiots because they can't even figure out how to click no thanks after the ad to watch live tv.,US,2014-07-10 04:00:00,5,Jacalope22,Idiots,841069888,
3439,All it does is open safari and shows you a guide of shows you can watch\, but not actually watch them. The only way to access any of them is to pay.,US,2014-07-08 22:54:00,1,mrtrevly,Useless,841069888,

3445,Worked great! Allows you to watch like 15 different channels. Live sports\, and previous whole seasons of some shows. Why is everyone so worried about giving your email address to Southwest?? Hello\, they have it already.Simply download the app. When you get on board\, no need to open the app\, just open safari (for Apple)\, enter email and go!

3465,Southwest emailed me saying it would be useful on my upcoming flight that has wifi. When I got on the flight\, there was no wifi. Deleted the app. Not sure why it's needed in the first place to play video.,US,2014-04-26 11:00:00,1,Direwolf20,Not used it,841069888,
3466,This app just creates an extra step to get to the page of SWA video content. Do yourself a favor and just open your browser on your device\, I deleted this app. If give it 0 stars.,US,2014-04-26 01:06:00,1,Jamiedhall,Awful!!,841069888,
3467,Ehhhhh,US,2014-04-25 03:19:00,3,Xczvbh,Meh,841069888,

3471,Because it's pretty useless on Southwest. All it does is take you to the Southwest portal to watch video...exactly where you would be taken if you didn't have the app. Maybe it works on other airlines\, but it was a waste of space for me so it was deleted immediately. Also...there are no help buttons\, and no support or user guides on the developer website as well. Is this there first rodeo?,US,2014-04-17 20:15:00,1,auldguy,Useful on other airlines?,841069888,
3472,As with many other reviewers\, I too downloaded the app Southwest told me to in a checkin email this morning and spent the whole time failing to get anything to work.Makes the ad backfire that they would never charge us to watch TV...I spent the money to get online to look for support and no luck.  :-(,US,2014-04-17 02:37:00,1,aradovan,Doesn't Work - Frustrating,841069888,

3481,I got it to work\, however\, I think the WiFi on my flight was cutting off intermittently and I had to restart it several times. I may try it again on my return flight to see if it works better. I did learn one thing about this software. Ignore any messages that it displays. Just open the app\, then open the movie page on WiFi and click the play button. The app will open\, ignore the message it displays\, and the movie should start. If you get a message that says your device won't play the movie\, ignore that too and keep trying.

4639,They no longer have any good prizes. Just stupid stuffed animals and codes for free shipping which you can find online anywhere. What happened to all of the great gift cards?

4645,This app is great especially if you go out a lot or if any of the shops are on your way to work or something like that. I wish there were more participating stores. One suggestion I can offer is in the store have the gift card go to another page where you can choose the value of it so we don't have to buy multiple 5 dollar gift cards. Great app overall I look forward to its continued growth,US,2014-08-06 17:21:00,4,Broshiki,Overall great,769439031,

4647,The value of the coins gets lower\, and lower\, and lower. The ease of picking coins up gets harder\, and harder\, harder.You can get stuff with this app\, but they're constantly raising the rates which often makes it feel like you're getting scammed.When I first started with this app the value of one coin was as much as 11 cents. And you could get as many as 10-15 coins a day just playing Fruit Ninja. Now\, the value of a one coin is 3.3 cents and you can earn one coin a day on Fruit Ninja. So a nearly 400% inflation rate in about six months\, and it's way more difficult to earn coins. Even the walk-in missions get you fewer coins.It's pretty frustrating when just as you reach the threshold for what you wanted to get\, the price goes up. Like I said\, you can get stuff\, but this app just gets worse and worse. Getting close to the point where I'm just going to get rid of it if things don't improve.,US,2014-07-13 06:10:00,2,SGuy42,Suffers from hyperinflation,769439031,
4648,I would like to start off by stating that the BeClub list of rewards section of the app doesn't ever load\, so I have to access a small portion of it from Fruit Ninja. At first\, it was 100 BeDollars for $5 gift cards. As soon as I reached 100 BeDollars\, the price changed to 125 BeDollars. I have 110 BeDollars now\, and Fruit Ninja stopped giving me tasks to earn BeDollars. I can't scan anything at stores because only half of the BeClub app works and I can't do it through Fruit Ninja. I don't know what the point of all of this is\, but I advise you not to waste your time with BeClub.,US,2014-06-22 23:23:00,1,This isn't relevant,Scam?,769439031,

4658,I've been using this app for a few months and earning points. Earning the points is really easy\, all you have to do is check into stores and maybe scan some things. You can earn points by playing fruit ninja as well. The rewards cycle out often\, so if they don't have something you like\, just wait a few weeks and they will have some new things. That also means that some may disappear before you can afford them though\, but that hasn't bothered me. Just wait for even better ones to come!,US,2014-04-22 03:50:00,5,Reviewer1497537,Happy,769439031,

4670,It never works\, gets stuck in validation screen\, doesn't recognize the store even if you are in the middle of the store\, wasted a lot time\, gas and energy by driving 30 miles daily hoping it works. :(. This app makes you walk crazy inside stores and look like (I don't know what to say),US,2014-03-02 13:06:00,1,_ramesh,Beware\, Hopeless App,769439031,

4673,Don't be a sucker....they lure you in with Bedollars from fruit ninja to get your information and then the Bedollars dry up. I can't believe I fell for this nonsense when I knew better.,US,2014-01-15 18:44:00,1,Gullible fruit ninja,Beware,769439031,

4675,I can tell that this company is new and just starting out with rewarding people there are no surveys you have to fill out you link your facebook to the app and to fruit ninja and then you get paid to have fun the app also sends you on adventures. I can not wait till they expand. The only problem i have encountered today was i went to the gap in my mall and there was no internet around and i have an ipod touch so i couldn't scan anything,US,2014-01-10 23:07:00,5,V4mp573r,This is wonderful!,769439031,

4980,I have been working with my trainer for three months now. I LOVE the service. I used to work with a personal trainer that charged $120/session. GAIN Fitness charges only a little more than that\, BUT I get workouts personalized for me\, from my trainer\, four times/ week. Essentially It costs me the same as meeting with my old trainer for an hour as it does now when I get around 20 workouts/ week from my trainer to do over the app\, in addition to meeting her in-person. Perfect for anyone that doesn't want to pay $120+ for a trainer do be with them in-person but still wants the structure and quality that a trainer provides. Also great for me because I don't have time to schedule training sessions but it is a service I appreciate and need.Really innovative service--highly recommend.,US,2014-11-26 18:07:00,5,NYGiantsFan1234,Personal Training of the Future,896273100,
4981,I joined GAIN Fitness a few months ago and have really enjoyed the experience so far.  Pleasantly surprised by how effective the virtual trainer relationship has been in getting me to workout more often and at a higher intensity. Also\, being assigned workouts keeps things fresh and interesting (it's too easy to fall into a boring routine when working out on your own).,US,2014-11-25 01:14:00,5,bhurlz,LOVE IT!!!,896273100,
4982,Personal training for on the go. Great app and much cheaper than a traditional personal trainer.,US,2014-10-19 17:59:00,5,Smart boy1232360,The best workout app,896273100,
4983,The biggest problem with this app is you can only enter one zip code to get pricing\, after that you are locked to that zip code and cannot change it. I live in fairfield county\, Connecticut so I had to do several accounts\, tried denver zip 80123 and it said not available\, finally did a San fran zip and got $129/month. If you pay a private trainer cash here\, one that doesn't work at a big box gym\, you can get nearly once a week training for that price. So the advertised 1/5th cost is misleading. Waste of time.,US,2014-10-12 19:55:00,2,numale,Not as advertised,896273100,
4984,I haven't been able to test this out because I entered ONE unsupported zip code and I was locked out for life.  I was planning to try a bigger city option around where I work but the zip code entry is a one time deal. Unless I try to delete the data for the app or delete the app Itself (which may work)\, then I have no chance of ever seeing this app in action. Please fix!,US,2014-09-27 06:08:00,3,ajx8141,One major flaw...,896273100,
4985,Full time mom + full time job. Really hard to keep exercise a priority even though I want to. This service has been great. My trainer plans these awesome workouts and then I actually do them cuz she'll know if I don't. :) I can do them at home or at the gym and whenever I'm (finally) available. It really does feel like having a trainer in you pocket.,US,2014-09-12 18:43:00,5,Mom-Mommy-Mom-Mom-Mom-MOM,Yay for flexibility and accountability,896273100,
4986,I can't believe how much progress I have made since starting with my GAIN trainer. We met at my local gym a few weeks ago and ever since I have been getting daily workouts from her sent to my phone through the GAIN app. I am training for my second half-marathon and knew I needed something a little more diverse to assist in my workout routine\, in addition to someone there to motivate me (aside from my workout partner) and hold me accountable for my workouts. In the past I have had a personal trainer but realized how expensive that got--plus\, who wants someone standing over them and counting their push ups for them! With the Hybrid Personal Training from GAIN\, I can workout where I want and when I want while having the luxury of the personal trainer to prescribe me workouts to help me get a PR in my half-marathon! Great app overall\, highly recommend for anyone who want to hit a goal. Seems a little pricey\, but in comparison to a traditional personal trainer..not so much.,US,2014-08-07 18:51:00,5,workoutgirl247,Best bang for your buck,896273100,
4987,I love this new way to work with a personal trainer. Constant accountability with a trainer and it's affordable!,US,2014-08-07 18:38:00,5,Blaine+Erin,Love it!,896273100,
4988,I always thought that having a personal trainer would be the best way get/stay in shape. Thank you GAIN Fitness to finally making it affordable!,US,2014-08-06 19:34:00,5,JanSchw,It works!!!,896273100,
4989,This is the future of personal training.  Cheaper than a full time trainer but just as motivating.  You have a real person on the other end designing your workout and keeping you accountable yet it won’t cost you several hundred dollars per week.,US,2014-08-06 18:50:00,5,Gringo fan,Revolutionary,896273100,
4990,My life is hectic and I've ignored my health in the past\, but hybrid personal training made it convenient to work with a trainer. After a month of service I am already seeing results.,US,2014-08-06 18:50:00,5,Waswaswaswas,Great app + great service,896273100,
4991,Meeting with a real trainer and having them keep me busy at the gym\, this is what I need.,US,2014-08-06 18:49:00,5,EliWin,Pretty cool,896273100,
4992,I have used GAIN's old apps for months but wanted something a little more personal and something to hold me accountable. I have met with my personal trainer twice now and could not imagine working out without a personal trainer. She gives me a new and challenging workouts to do every day and then follows up with me to see how it went and asks if I have any questions. My wedding is three months away and I can already tell I am going to be happy with the way I look!,US,2014-08-06 18:49:00,5,Laxnswimming33,Awesome app! Already seeing changes,896273100,
4993,App provides a great way for me to keep in touch with my trainer as a travel. Loving it so far.,US,2014-08-05 03:22:00,5,KevinKings,Happy with my new trainer,896273100,
4994,Way cheaper than a personal trainer\, and more effective too. You get told what to do\, when to do it\, and how via the app\, and you can IM your coach anytime. I also dig how your 'plan' takes into account your activity outside the gym. I don't need a personal trainer standing over me at a gym as i work out. Having a coach send me workouts and check in periodically to keep me honest works better\, so I think the new gain has the right idea.,US,2014-08-04 23:56:00,5,Stokedbloke2,Awesome way to work out,896273100,

5387,The game is fine except for the spinning odds which are not even close to actual odds. This makes the game frustrating to play. I tried to ignore it but I had 5 consecutive spins across online and single player that were loss spins (lose turn\, broke\, etc).

I would love to see a way to let my opponent know it is there turn to remind them to play. I would love to see avatars or some animations! This is a fun game\, and I love it just the way it is\, but would also love some of these other things to be consideredThank you very much! ❤️ One more very important thing to me would be for me to be able to have a lot more than only 3 tries to play a game by myself!

5799,The programmers have thought out the interface making it easy to use. I love the mosaic of images instead of the one-at-a-time as Tumblr displays. I *HIGHLY* recommend this app if you follow a good number of people on Tumblr. THAT BEING SAID\, the downside to the app is that it doesn't always remember to highlight LIKED posts or FOLLOWED blogs.  After you click on an image to like it\, it occasionally says 'UNLIKED POST'\, because the heart wasn't already red to alert you that you'd already LIKED it before.  Same goes for BLOGS.  You may have followed someone before\, but the indicator showing you follow someone doesn't always appear.  Two small glitches that keep me from giving it a 5 star rating.  Fix that\, and I'll upgrade my review to 5 stars.,US,2014-11-25 21:19:00,3,Brace_Bear,Hits basically every need for Tumblr\, but needs tweeks.,531571259,

5809,I love this app for my multiple Tumblr photo blogs. It is ALMOST there but I wish it had a few more options. It's awesome for browsing and reblogging hundreds of blogs but please add these features:- The ability to turn off the 'picture liked' notification or at least shorten the length of time it pops up. I know I liked it - it turns the heart red. :)- The ability to EDIT my posts - The ability to view my drafts or queue. And most importantly - THE ABILITY TO VIEW HOW MANY LIKES AND THE COMMENTS OF A POST - any post. I upgraded to the pay version. It is worth the price. If any of these features already exist I apologize but I can't find them. Please let me know.,US,2014-10-11 16:26:00,4,httpexplosion,I love this app but wish I could give 5 stars,531571259,

5819,Great app!The only missing essential feature is the ability to view pics in landscape. I would give it 5 stars if it had that feature...,US,2014-05-10 13:52:00,4,bb_referee,Great Way to View Pics on Tumblr,531571259,
5820,App displays all thumbnails distorted - compressed horizontally - unlike every other Tumblr app I've used.  There is nothing in the docs\, FAQ\, help\, etc about this issue.Throws connectivity errors when every other app is working fine over a high speed WiFi connection.Throws low memory errors on a freshly booted 32GB phone when it's the only app running.Why was this even released?And why did I pay even $1 for it?,US,2014-05-07 18:27:00,1,Gomezcaline,buggy\, unuseable,531571259,

5823,I've had this app for awhile now and it is pretty amazing and straight forward. I don't even use tumblr on my computer any more but it would be nice to see some new features.,US,2014-04-02 11:32:00,4,ThatKiddSkipp,New features would be nice,531571259,
5824,The TumbleOn team seriously raised the bar! Incredibly feature rich\, this Tumblr client has a super clean interface\, is easy to use\, and is down right enjoyable to navigate.  It is clear that these folks took their time and thoroughly thought out each process. Intelligent design at its finest.,US,2014-04-02 01:34:00,5,JimiMat,Well done!,531571259,

5828,Wish there was a feature for saving drafts (if there is idk how to do it) and that my own blog info was little more easily accessible. Otherwise very fun and easy :),US,2014-01-18 16:31:00,4,RACHEL BRODY,Love! Just couple things I'd like,531571259,

5831,I literally use(d) this app every single day since I discovered it. I used it on my iPhone 4S. I just upgraded and got a new iPhone (5s) and downloaded the app immediately. It keeps saying reblog failed\, liked failed ect. So I downloaded the actual tumblr app and I can do my normal everyday stuff on it. Please help!!,US,2014-01-11 19:39:00,3,Adrian Allen,Used to LOVE this app!!,531571259,

5834,If your tumblr feed is primarily images\, this app is fantastic! It's limited to viewing 300 posts and it's only b/c this app that I've ever viewed 300 posys,US,2014-01-05 04:20:00,5,KGeezy67,Images!,531571259,
5835,I love it I love it I love it. I can browse images quickly and easy and it allows a tremendous amount of enjoyment. My one request: please please allow some copy/saving to reading services like Pocket\, Evernote\, and such! I'd like to save some of these things\, but email really doesn't cut it and copy/paste is rather clunky. Thanks!,US,2014-01-02 20:11:00,5,Otter^3,So close to perfect!,531571259,
5836,This has been the better app for tumblr to me. I own them all and ofcourse all have its problems but this one still hasnt cut out on me yet. The interface is awesome; very fluent\, its fast and offers everything it should i believe. I cant stand the notification box that pops up up top everytime you reblog or favorite something\, it gets in the way and takes too long to go away for me. Also the auto fresh\, i would prefer to refresh the page manually because i could go so far into someones blog but come back a short time later and have to start back from the beginning.,US,2014-01-02 16:49:00,5,BENEFiELDAVON,Think i finally found the right one,531571259,
5837,Totally liked it more before the update. The side scrolling isn't as clear\, the images are more blurry but is fixed of if you click on them to enlarge them. Overall great app though,US,2013-12-30 20:09:00,4,Magathar,Review,531571259,

5843,I like to use this app which is greater than official!The reason for me is mostly ability to take different kind of blogs into GROUPS. But I still missing navigation gestures from official app!First of all remove that annoying 'get-back-to-dashboard-button' from full screen. We are waiting in the next update for gestures:• Click on image to full screen\, thenDouble click to zoom (pinch should work as well to people who likes that way)\, and then Click or Swipe Up to get back to Dashboard. In Dashboard: Double Click to LIKE/UNLIKE (will be nice to have this option but not necessary).• Thumbnails in Dashboard ROWS are poor quality\, scaling is bad. Repair that or give us poor/HD option in settings for that. Some other graphics are scaled bad in the app as well. What's next...• when getting to full screen that 'information arrow tip' should appear only with first use of app\, not every time!• When scrolling pictures in full screen mode\, rows should follow in the background\, so when we get out of full screen there should be actual position adequate to last picture we seen in full screen. Great job guys! We are waiting for big update!,US,2013-11-15 08:04:00,3,happyuser_iPhone4,Great app but need new features!,531571259,

5845,The app is great. I've been using it for a while and actually prefer it to the official tumblr app. But I don't like the new app icon. What is that symbol even supposed to mean? The previous look was much cuter in my opinion.,US,2013-11-04 19:04:00,5,zenihita,What's with the icon?,531571259,
5846,If you use tumblr\, do yourself a favor and pick this app up; it's great!Only complaint would be lack of ability to manage/maintain your tumblr post que - otherwise a 5 star app.,US,2013-11-04 07:46:00,3,Motorjed,Solid\, inexpensive tumblr app,531571259,

5856,Love the app\, great way to view tumblr images\, clean interface. There are some issues with it I hope get resolved such as implementing horizontal mode\, a way to save animated gifs (to photo roll or to a tumbleon repository)\, and an easier way to exit out of an image (the button to close it is far too small). Otherwise great app and I look forward to the changes and how this app evolves!,US,2013-09-29 00:29:00,4,TalkingtoUU,Great App but Needs Fixes,531571259,

5859,Good news: the interface has been refreshed and it looks nicer but...Bad news: the save function requires more steps and slows down the interface significantly. This is especially true if you are on a slow connection. Can no longer speedily queue images to save as you now have to wait for each image to save individually before you can look at another. Big enough pain that I am thinking about rolling back to the previous version. Also in the previous version you had a visual cue the app was doing something. Not anymore so I kept thinking the app had locked up. Another big bad is there is no longer a speedy way to view the tumblrs you are following. Now you need to do several clicks to check. Another big pain. Why oh why did you ever think embedding these operations with more clicks would help?,US,2013-09-21 23:51:00,2,Mandolo00,Good news and bad news,531571259,

5861,When I open the explorer window nothing appears so since I installed iOS 7 app longer works for my blogs I have followed . It's too bad animated gifs don't animate in preview mode you have to individually open each file to see the animation. If you like you can scroll the animated gifs once the animation is open so you can see the animated gifs but it's very slow scrolling\, Tumblr is faster. Also with sets of pictures you can't save just one of the pictures in the set you have to save the whole set that's not a problem with tumbler.,US,2013-09-19 22:04:00,1,Bob Van Ess,Does not work with iOS7,531571259,
5862,Completely broken for iOS 7. Can't link tumblr account. Can't see pictures. Not much else to say. This is as of 9/19.,US,2013-09-19 10:49:00,1,Prograham,Stay away if u have iOS 7,531571259,

5876,Short version - great advances features but doesn't do the basic minimum functions like landscape rotation(!) Based on their help section and support videos its designed for iPad and doesn't work properly on the iPhone. I tried to contact support but after 4 days have only received an automated response. I give two stars rather than one because of the slick interface and advanced features that seem to work great on an iPad. Unfortunately if you need a tumblr image app for the iPhone this isn't the one for you.,US,2013-07-31 20:10:00,2,gschoen,Made for iPad NOT iPhone,531571259,

5891,Doesn't cache the tiny thumbnails\, so when you go back to bookmarks you have to wait for them all to load again.  But it works well\, and makes it easy to browse tumbles I follow.  Can't find a topical search function\, you seem to have to know the precise name if a tumblr to find it. I'm glad to have it\, use it almost daily,US,2013-05-07 05:09:00,4,thaikarl,Works well,531571259,

5895,So my one gripe with the official tumblr app is that it doesn't support push notifications. This app doesn't either. Though I like the look and interface here much better\, I'd like to be notified when something happens. Gifs would be nice to create but I have a separate app for that. The only other thing I have a problem with is that I can't post anything other than photos. If they included the ability to post everything tumblr is capable of and enabled push notifications\, it would be a 5 star app.,US,2013-04-29 10:33:00,3,Thisisntmii,No notifications +,531571259,

5900,I really like it!!,US,2013-04-11 01:54:00,5,Ki Shea,Great!,531571259,

5902,I love how this app warns me when I'm about to go on 4G the wifi in my house is spotty. This app is just amazing. Like I don't get why people give this an horrible review maybe they just don't know how to you use it. I love how this app doesn't store a whole bunch of stuff to your phone like the other Tumblr apps and the Original Tumblr® app does. I'm just glad that it is so user friendly.,US,2013-04-01 03:59:00,5,iOSTechNews,I honestly love TumbleOn ☺,531571259,
5903,I stumbled across TumbleOn Free when I was searching for an alternative for other Tumblr app. I liked it so much that I bought paid TumbleOn version. This has got to be one of the best Tumblr app out there\, it plays the gifs smoothly and reblogging is easy as well as liking or even saving the picture to your phone. So forget all of the other apps for Tumblr\, TumbleOn is the best. Thank you developers for this awesome app!,US,2013-03-30 19:33:00,5,ColaKhoa,Best Tumblr App Out There!,531571259,
5904,Great app and swift as ever! Easy to use. Love it!,US,2013-03-27 20:47:00,5,drapesiPad,Moves swiftly,531571259,
5905,Best app for tumblr\, hands down! And the devs are very kind\, very fast and efficient and so helpful! I had a bug report a while back and sent in a report and the devs contacted me right away. This is the ideal app for both casual and hardcore tumblr users\, it's very easy to use and has the slickest UI. Definitely worth the very humble price. And it's stable unlike the other tumblr apps available today (tried about 99% of them tbh)\, that crash and are really little more than a viewer for tumblr's mobile interface. Tumbleon is so much more than a viewer\, it's an experience.One thing I'm waiting to see is support for queues. Add that and it'd definitely get 5 stars from me.,US,2013-03-26 00:13:00,4,바나나우유❤,Perfect!,531571259,
5906,Just need to support video or the space where video would be. I have to use a combination of mobile apps to get to whole experience. But it is stylish.,US,2013-03-22 22:55:00,3,AL Williams,Looks good,531571259,
5907,I was really struggling with the mobile version of Tumblr- slow\, one thread at a time. This app loads thumbnails very fast for multiple blogs; it's easy to make a selection based on what you see. It lets you know if new photos posted since your last visit\, has well-placed icons to reblog\, like\, download\, etc. Seems like it was made for how I want to look at things.,US,2013-03-20 23:50:00,5,ChiGaySpirit,This is Great,531571259,
5908,I really love all the features of this app! The .99 cents was definitely worth it! I love the analyze feature where to can see what blogs other blogs reblog from most frequently. It's a great way to find new blogs to follow. I also really like being able to look up blogs. I recommend this to everyone!,US,2013-03-19 04:12:00,5,jamminnnnnnn,Great App!,531571259,

5910,Does everything the tumblr app doesn't - fast photo posting\, easy tagging\, easily switch between accounts (& have multiple accounts permanently logged in). Only thing that could be improved is the ability to edit the captions/tags after the photo is posted.,US,2013-03-17 20:23:00,5,Meredith Rivas,Perfect,531571259,

5915,I LOVE this app! It's fantastic. That being said\, it won't let me log on anymore. I have multiple account and I've tried logging into them all\, it will let me log on then hit 'accept' then it says page not found so it won't actually log me on. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and turning it off then back on and It just won't work.,US,2013-03-02 14:24:00,3,victoriayork,,531571259,

5917,The best app for Tumblr. Would be nice to get stats\, landscape by turning device\, and view more than 300 posts to the blogs you follow without reloading\, but mandated by Tumblr 3rd party apps. Worth the download.,US,2013-02-25 20:50:00,4,Jagger?,Best Tumblr App,531571259,

5940,This is perfect if you primarily follow/reblog tumblrs that only post images\, since it gives you a nice layout of thumbnails to browse through the posts on your dashboard and whoever you're following. Note that you shouldn't depend on this if you follow blogs that include a few text or video entries every so often that you'd be interested in reading. Since it's designed for image browsing\, it omits any entries that don't at least have a picture. Another downside: while it is a universal app (yay!)\, it doesn't currently support syncing (so read entries on one device is still unread on another). The developers have said that this feature is coming soon though. Also: no portrait mode on iPad and no landscape mode on iPhone. I don't see these as deal breakers though\, but you might.,US,2013-01-09 07:21:00,5,mrngoitall,Great for following image-based tumblr feeds!,531571259,

5947,I love literally just about everything. Loads well\, great layout\, dashboard\, multi-accounts. It warns me often if there isn't enough memory\, and reblogging/queueing is easy. The only problem is I wish you could load more than 300 posts on the dashboard\, and maybe be able to see likes on your other accounts. That could make a great future update! Other than that it'sA great app and I love having it on my phone. New fav.,US,2012-12-25 15:43:00,4,Shieruu,Great App,531571259,
5948,Love the fluid feel of this app! The analyze blog feature is really innovative\, can find blogs of my interest a lot faster than hash tags. Would rate 5 stars if I were able to see text posts\, other than that great app!,US,2012-12-25 08:58:00,4,westcoastrants,great app.,531571259,

5951,Ok\, it's a little odd to hide the dashboard under 'bookmarks'. But why is it that the app does not rotate with device? Seriously? It's for viewing images\, one should assume the need to rotate the device to see landscape sized photos. I really want to believe its a setting somewhere\, but there isn't. Am I missing something ?!,US,2012-12-18 20:03:00,2,iAladdin,Rotate?,531571259,

5954,Now my favorite tumblr app. Makes checking my dash and surfing blogs really easy and fun. I would like an option to disable the 'This post was liked.' popup\, as it's redundant since the heart color changes. I would also like the option of viewing text posts\, maybe a toggle? These would make this a five-star app for sure.All in all\, way worth the money.,US,2012-12-13 16:56:00,4,ionhelen,Clean\, intuitive\, and responsive,531571259,
5955,I really like app for viewing tumblr on. It replaces tumbliking for me since they seemed to stop supporting it. But this app is great\, I love the multiple line view :),US,2012-12-11 01:37:00,5,crhannig,Great app,531571259,
5956,This is my go to app for Tumblr. First got hooked on it on the iPad\, now that I have only an iP5\, life is still good. Could stand a few more features but the  again it is the mobile version.,US,2012-12-08 23:53:00,5,Laid Back Man,Nearly flawless,531571259,
5957,This was once a Hall of Fame (5 stars) app now you can not do anything on the app but look at certain blogs. It will not let reblog photos you can not like photos you can not even view your own dashboard What Gives? This is not a free app at least tell you ate having issues! I email me tumbleon and still no reply. FYI stick to the official Tumblr it's free and allows to view your own dashboard... Save yourself some money!!!,US,2012-12-08 14:53:00,1,GRJR721,What Happen?,531571259,

5960,This is an elegant way to browse picture posts on your tumblr dashboard HOWEVER\, every reblog gets stamped with 'Via TumbleOn' which is a link to their site. I don't mind the advertisement but it should be an option for the more 'professional' bloggers.,US,2012-11-26 02:36:00,3,hifibry,Great\, pretty app BUT--,531571259,
5961,I love using this app! It's much faster to look through my dashboard unlike the original tumblr app. The only thing that i kinda dislike about this app is that whenever i post or queue a post a message always pops up saying that i posted it. There is nothing wrong with it but it just gets annoying sometimes... I wish it wouldn't pop up every time i posted or queued something. There are also some things that bother me but i can deal with it.  Hopefully this app won't disappear like what happened to the imgtumble app because i seriously love and prefer this to any other tumblr apps. So overall i REALLY enjoy using this app. Really recommend it for any tumblr users. ,US,2012-11-25 19:35:00,5,Pandabear84,LOVE IT ,531571259,

5985,I've used most of the other tumblr apps and well those sucked a lot compared to this. It has all the features of the paid apps plus more for one low price. It needs to have a feature so you can post other than just photos\, like the normal tumblr app. And a way to see how many people have rebloged a certain picture (Notes) like the tumblr app. You have all of the features that set you apart from other tumblr apps\, but you need to add/work on the basics to be the best.

6000,There are a couple missing standard image conveniences like the ability to view in landscape mode. It doesn't seem to have a view similar to the main tumblr dashboard. Like all other mobile versions I've tried\, this too does not you edit the source or click through on reblog. Yes\, it's better than the rest I've tried and many cool features\, these seem to me to be basic functionality. I'll keep using it\, but hope these get addressed in the future.,US,2012-10-23 23:29:00,4,incredinex,Pretty Good,531571259,

6020,This is a great app. I only have one complaint: it doesn't allow you to rotate the device and view it in landscape mode. It's the best way to view images\, slideshows\, etc. Fix that\, and you'll get five stars from me.,US,2012-09-11 14:19:00,4,TerranceDC,Needs landscape mode,531571259,

6027,As of version 3.2 the app is crashing far less often. Although\, it still crashes quite a bit. I do like the recent feature to report the problem but never can perform the exact steps to reproduce. Likely a memory leak issue. I use this app mostly to find similar blogs\, via the 'Analyze Reblogs' feature. Feature enhancements would include:1. Support for tagging my own content. 2. Searching for tags from other blogs. 3. Filtering my own posts out of the 'dashboard' results. 4. Sync or export/import of 'groups' for multiple devices. 5. Display an indication of a 'favorited' item. 6. Fix the indication if I'm following a blog. It seems to work\, but is frequently inaccurate (i.e.\, does not indicate that I am following a blog\, when I actually am). 7. Display more blog statistics (e.g.\, number of users I'm following\,  number of users following me\, number of posts\, last activity date\, etc).The other tumblr app that I use regularly is Tumbletail. If I could merge these apps I would be ecstatic.,US,2012-09-07 04:28:00,4,Veektote,Great app\, getting better! Needs features to be my go to...,531571259,

6131,I love it and so do my players! It's really easy to use and the smart phone interface makes everyone's busy schedule a little easier.  I've tried multiple apps like this and this one is the only one that comes close.  My only suggestion would be to have the ability to print up a batting order with fielding positions for each inning within the app. Thanks Teamsnap!,US,2014-11-13 09:46:00,5,airnaugle,Awesome App,393048976,

6134,This app has allowed me to manage multiple youth sports teams. It is efficient to use and allows parents\, coaches\, and players to be in the loop. One thing I would suggest is a recurrence option. Often practices or trainings occur on the same day and same time. Otherwise\, great app!,US,2014-11-11 20:39:00,4,richjenn,Love the app!,393048976,
6135,Good app. Wish it were cheaper per month for paid subscription. Teams only last 8 weeks for some sports\, and my wife and I coach two teams together. Gets spendthrift for volunteer coaches.,US,2014-11-11 09:41:00,5,Pcmobiletechs,Well done,393048976,

6143,We use the app for my kids teams ... The free items are great but the in app purchase items should be free ... They are items that would be very useful but not worth $7/month ... Should have option on free app that we can create seasons with our teams instead of having to start from scratch every year ... They offer premium services but still have advertising so what's the difference,US,2014-11-09 23:02:00,3,Love 2 B N London,GOOD APP BUT NOT GREAT,393048976,

6150,No more long email or text chains just to find out who can make the game. Schedule events and monitor availability easily. Even players that are tech challenged just have to click a link in the game email to confirm availability. This app saves me hours a week. Only improvement I would like to see is a 'reserve roster' where manager can activate reserves on a game by game basis. Otherwise I love everything about TeamSnap.,US,2014-11-07 22:05:00,5,Dragons Hockey Club,Team Management made super easy,393048976,

6152,This version of the app is unusable. At the top schedule\, the team names are gone\, so I have no idea which child/team is playing.  I have to go into the event for details\, and there's no way to get back out\, other then restarting the app. A big step backward for this app.,US,2014-11-07 20:33:00,1,Zxy123abc8876aasdeewrt,Unusable,393048976,

6158,I've used this app to track my son's soccer practices and game schedule along with game results and team messages for over a year (written 11/6/14) and found it very useful. Not only does the schedule include time and location but has lost links to maps on my phone to provide driving directions and times. You can copy the schedule to your phone's calendar and get an alert based on where you are and travel time (including traffic). All in all\, integrated and very helpful on my iPhone.,US,2014-11-06 18:00:00,5,4q,Team snap,393048976,

6163,I really like almost all the aspects of this application. Great flexibility for dealing with team management. My only MAJOR beef with this app is its photo storage capabilities. The company does not take in to account that parents/players want to up/download hi-res photos. No one wants to down load a lo-res photo for display...The processing to view photos is very slow on any device. On my phone or IPad the app quits many times if you try to look at the photos in any other view than thumbnail view. Fix this and it would be 5 star!,US,2014-11-03 16:44:00,3,beth matthews,Great Sports Admin App but...,393048976,

6166,I manage and coach multiple teams. Without the app\, I would be disorganized at best. Wish it weren't few per team and having them take 2 percent is a bit much as all they do is connect to paypal.,US,2014-11-02 00:19:00,4,Coolthing4you,Good app,393048976,

6173,This app has some great features but a few more would really help. It would be nice to have a picture icon next to the uniform listing so that a picture of the uniform instead of only text could be used. Also\, it would be nice to be able to see the player statistics in the apple app instead of only on the full website. Otherwise this app is great!,US,2014-11-01 14:15:00,4,Zeke1966,Good app but would like a few improvements,393048976,

6175,We stated using Team Snap when we put our team together. It has been beneficial in scheduling practices and games\, also sends out reminders to parents.

6181,Excellent app for managing a team\, it's roster and schedule. Very easy to notify parents of changes and add new events. Only complaint is with visual elements. There is no easy way to review your season's record. Yes you can see your overall league record but not the total record for the team (including non-league) and what the scores of each game were. They should add a results tab or something. When you go to past events you can see opponents but to see the score you need to pretend your editing the score.,US,2014-10-30 23:17:00,4,moxiesteve,Great app but could be improved,393048976,

6192,The features are there but the navigation is not so intuitive and cumbersome. Still\, it's the best in class and with steady improvement\, can stay that way. Needed:- multiple team support- one-step status update- team dashboard at the home screen,US,2014-10-27 15:30:00,4,Fabrikatur,One step short of great,393048976,
6193,I used it for a whole year!It really helped me to manage my team and players. I only found one (BIG) issue and is that you cannot set a limited amount of players for a game\, so if for example you have 25 players on your roster but only a max of 10 spots to play on a game\, once those 10 spots are filled\, it doesn't close the game\, it keeps allowing players to subscribe to the game\, so you can expect 13 or 17 or more players going to the game thinking that there is a spot for them.Make sure you check constantly and inform these extra players that either the game is full or place them in some sort of substitutes list,US,2014-10-27 00:49:00,3,Cardenetas,Very Good App..!!!,393048976,

6210,I LOVE this app.  I've used it for several years as a hockey mom/team manager but I have to say that this last update is lousy.  While at a hockey tournament\, I was asked to check on a players availability and couldn't because the app kept crashing and kicking me out. Please fix the issue so I can give you 5 stars.  I can only depend on team snap when I'm at home on my computer\, you've rendered my iPhone and iPad useless.,US,2014-10-18 16:30:00,2,38Dancer,Crash and burn!,393048976,

6350,The premium product is outstanding. It really helps organize teams activities\, especially the availability function.  It saves me the trouble of sending notes to parents nagging them about their child's availability.  My only complaint is that the site is always asking me for more money.

6400,I started coaching my daughters soccer team 12 years ago.   Since then\, I've also coached her basketball team and my sons baseball\, soccer and basketball teams.   I only wish TeamSnap was around 12 years ago.   As the kids approach 13-14 yrs old\, they have other activities to do\, so you need to know who's planning to be at the game.   The only problem with TeamSnap is that it can't make the parents update the info\, even when a reminder email is sent.    EMPHASIZE with your parents at the beginning of the season your need to know who will be at the game.  Ever had to FORFEIT a game ?   Not any fun for anyone.  Give them a deadline of 2 days prior to the game to update\, if it still shows 'unknown'.  If still no response 2 days prior\, tell them their child will not be able to play due to the lack of updating TeamSnap.,US,2014-07-20 15:20:00,5,Hansryij,GREAT Way to Organize the Team,393048976,

6425,I have been running my men's over30 team for years with my Google gmail\, Contacts\, and Calendar\, which are great under the right conditions.  But using an iPad lately and my PC at work stuck with an old version of IE\, things have been awkward.  My assistant started us on teams nap and I have only gotten good feedback.  I'm still new to actually using the tool\, but it has helped me.  There are things that could be better\, mainly I don't understand why my manager login gives me full access in Safari but not in the snap app.  Some reviewers have complained about the optional fees\, but $8 for an entire team\, if that's how it's works\, seems reasonable.  we may try it.,US,2014-06-06 04:17:00,4,lenupinNH,Players like it\, makes running team a little easier,393048976,

6480,I've been searching for an app like this for a long time. I can't say how usefull this app is on both PC and iPhone. As a coach it centralizes all my information and allows my team to communicate between themselves and me. I've used Frontrush for recruiting purposes for a long time and this is very similar but makes everything much easier and accessible. I hope to see continual improvements over time.

6492,Great idea but in order to track items such as snacks or send text messages you have to pay $7.99 a month.  I paid the fee for one month to try basically wanting the text messaging feature but in order to use the text messaging you have to ask the parents to select their carriers. I'm looked up other apps and they don't charge all the extras so I will be trying a different sports app next season.   Also the schedule downloads to my iphone but not my ipad because it says it's already enabled on another device.,US,2014-04-14 23:03:00,2,Cubby Momma,Great app but $7.99 monthly fee really use features,393048976,

6653,I've used Team Snap for 2 years and it works great for a team calendar program. I wish it had more features specific to coaching teams of individual athletes however. I create multiple workouts for different athletes who are all members of the same team and there is no way to handle this need in the app or program. This weakness leaves the door open for other developers to create an app with hierarchy in the design element. Thousands of track\, XC\, swim\, and wrestling coaches would LOVE this feature. However if all you need is an excellent team calendar program\, Team Snap is a great choice.,US,2014-01-12 14:26:00,5,CoachBarlow,Great app\, still missing feature for XC & Track coaches,393048976,

6937,This is a great app to use as a player. My coach has used it for 3 years now\, and it is great to be able to quickly find all the info on future and past games. The integration with maps and calendar is seamless. The other feature I use the most is marking my availability for an upcoming game. That's handy for the coach\, and I enjoy seeing who all will be there for the game. This app has improved over time\, and i have no doubt that new features and tweaks will be added.,US,2013-08-06 11:46:00,5,Joebi-wan,Great app!,393048976,

6943,Our soccer club has used this program for the past 2 years and thus we use the app on the iPhone and iPads. It is easy to use as a manager and as a parent. The interactive part is great! But to use the texting ability to be useful for the manager\, everyone has to log who their carrier is. This can be a slow process when you have 15+ families and getting them to do it.Love the ability to upload photos!Overall it is a good way to stay connected with your team for schedules\, cancellations\, last minute changes and general info.,US,2013-08-04 12:22:00,4,soccerslayer165,Useful App!,393048976,

6968,I really like this app.  As a team manager and coach\, this is 5 star program.  However\, I gave it 3 stars because the parents (a.k.a. the moms) have not been huge fans. The main reason is that when you make a schedule change and notify the team\, the email notice does not specify or highlight what has changed.  This creates confusion and several more emails from me to clarify.  As a result\, I have mostly stopped using the notifications and resorted to the email feature to inform the team of schedule changes.  If TeamSnap could add a message box for the team manager to write a comment and better yet choose (from a list) what goes in the subject line\, I would give the app 5 stars.This app has the ability to over communicate to the point of annoyance.  Be careful what you setup for notifications as too many emails can be as bad or worse than no communication.,US,2013-07-27 13:08:00,3,Gthxxx,Great for team managers,393048976,

7021,The 'team availability' feature is especially useful to me (a youth soccer coach) as I am often having to determine how many players will attend our game so that I may plan my formation and put players where they fit best.

As the team mom for our competitive softball team (and my husband is the head coach)\, we couldn't be nearly as efficient in communicating with the team and with each other without Team Snap.

It saves the coaches/parents time and frustration when all you need to know is in one place. Plus you get an app on your phone which makes it even more convenient.   No more 100 text or emails back and forth that don't make sense.  I would highly recommend that all coaches use this form of communicating with the parents.

7459,Our baseball team uses this app and we love it!

7462,Nice and convenient on the iPhone\, but even though the app store claims its compatible with the iPad I've never been able to use it. Crashes immediately. Three stars until that's fixed\, but if you exclusively use your phone\, it's actually pretty good,US,2013-02-15 03:06:00,3,Warhammer35,Not for iPad.,393048976,
7463,I use TeamSnap to manage 10 teams and it makes my life so much easier.  Their iOS app\, however\, is so buggy that you shouldn't even bother with it.  With each update I'm hopeful that the folks at TeamSnap made some improvements\, but uploads can still take over a minute.Most of our coaches now just go directly to the website on their iPhone and skip the app altogether.,US,2013-02-13 15:16:00,1,Coach Rex,Waste of Time,393048976,

7473,If you are looking for a software that is relatively inexpensive\, and yet chuck full of features\, this is it. I have used several different types by different companies\, but none compare to Team Snap. The Mobil app is almost as powerful as the website. They are working daily to get closer to that reality. The Mobil app may not be 100% of online login\, but it is still the strongest out there. There is nothing more satisfying than bringing lunch in to the hotel during travel\, going in the app and texting in one swoop everyone to come eat\, then minutes later the herd comes a running!  So many features that are useful besides that. I don't know how I did it all before. This is wonderful. If you do have problems\, their tech support is very responsive and helpful. Also\, if you think of an idea you would like implemented\, tell them. They have done so with two of my requests already!  Highly recommended.,US,2013-02-08 20:37:00,5,Dasgoob,The very BEST team management software,393048976,
7474,Absolutely great for teams.,US,2013-02-06 07:16:00,4,elam-c,Great App!!!,393048976,
7475,The latest iOS update for this app ROCKS!  You now have the capabilities to truly manage your teams on the go. If you have a league\, team or teams you have to check this App and service out.

7546,Teamsnap is an awesome tool for juggling schedules for multiple teams. I have each of my boys' teams and my team in Teamsnap and use the app on my iPhone 4 to manage our sports schedule. I haven't had the crashing problem that some others have had with the app. We use the premium version to upload all of our pics from games and tournaments so parents can access them.

7593,I like the theory of this app\, but last night I could assign refreshments\, but that option is gone today.  How do you assign refreshments?

7597,App would be 4 out of 5 if you could access the same tabs in the app as you have online (refreshments\, tracking\, etc)     and ability for mgr to set availability for others.,US,2012-09-15 02:30:00,2,Desmomx2,App is not bad but needs more,393048976,
7598,So let me start by clarifying on that statement.  The app does what's advertised\, although you do have to add the schedule and roster through the website.  Sort of a pain but oh well. Then the app is up and running perfecting for the first 30 days until the free trial period runs OUT.  After the trial period is over then all of the features that make the app cool are stripped away and your left with a shell of an app that is virtually useless unless you pony-up $9.99/month.  What an original business model\, you steal that model from AOL!   I'm sorry but I don't get paid to coach/ manage my kids soccer team nor do I get paid to manage my adult rec volleyball team.  Call me cheap but it's not wort paying a monthly subscription for the features that actually make this app functional. I've deleted that app and am going back to using shutterfly's team management app/website.,US,2012-09-01 12:30:00,1,Sweep Da Leg,Not so great...,393048976,

7606,I've been using Teamsnap for about 4 months now.  The service is a 4/5\, but the app is 2/5.  The majority of the people on our team don't use the app at all\, so it would be ideal if the manager of the team could set the status for everyone\, as well as enter scores and assign beverages\, etc.  I would give 4 stars for those things.  Bonus would be if I could manage payments on the app.  That would round it out to a 5.,US,2012-07-09 10:32:00,2,Dub,Needs work,393048976,

7619,Teamsnap is a great web site\, this app is ok not at all as good a site though. The app needs all the functions the website has. Would get 5 stars is the app mirrored the website. Also need to make app for iPad screen is size of an iPod looks ridiculous when using it on the iPad. Would give 5 stars if it was as described.,US,2011-10-03 03:16:00,3,B.

7624,As far a view and check info app for your team\, it's excellent. The layout is appealing and user friendly. What I'm hoping in upcoming updates is the admin capability like the web base version. Right now I would open the full website and login in order to do admin features. Would love it to be all incorporated in this app. Would get 5 stars if this occur.

7626,I've always thought the TeamSnap web site was a masterpiece of user interface design\, so this app has some big shoes to fill. Based on an hour or so of messing around with the app as a team memember (not a team admin\, I'll do that later) I think the iPhone app is by and large a success. Certainly for version 1.0 it's an easy 4 out of 5 stars.

Down the road I could see additional features to take advantage of the portable nature of the iPhone and that fact it could be out on the field (or court\, or whatever) with the user. But a very solid first effort. Nice work.,US,2010-10-01 19:22:00,4,Chaskerr4,Big Shoes,393048976,

7628,Love Team Snap's web version and was really looking forward to the app for easier usage however it is pretty limited to just schedules and messages.

Also would like to see the ability to email schedules to friends and grandparents.,US,2010-10-01 03:48:00,3,2jbens,It's getting there,393048976,

7630,Definitely a step up from logging into the website\, but can seriously use improvements for Team Managers.  For Managers\, there should be a 'team attendence' button right on the opening page.  Additionally\, the ability for managers to change individuals' attendence status is needed.A good first step\, for sure -- LONG overdue!

I was on my iPod and I needed a calling app. I downloaded a bunch of them but you had to buy or credits for calling and texting but that took forever.

7692,Okay I have to admit\, this app is really cool. But seriously? A character count? I can't even use my emojis or anything. Please get rid of that. Also\, the permanent signature thing is ridiculous. Why would my friends want to get an app that doesn't let you take away the signature unless you pay money? Way to advertise a ripoff! Please get rid of that too. Besides that\, it's great. But seriously. Make people pay for phone credits and removing those advertisements\, not the freaking signature.

7710,You can use this as a backup phone when you sell on craigslist and not give out your real number. Unfortunately text messages often come hours later or you'll never receive them. The free phone is decent although you have to download a bunch of other apps to get free minutes to use or you have to pay. The texts are unlimited but not reliable. All in all it's ok cause it's free. But they have to improve texting and delivery time,US,2014-11-10 17:29:00,2,Ageless Music,It's free,426224730,

7713,I use UppTalk to text my cousin who lives far away from me. I've texted and called her on UppTalk for three months now and so far I haven't been experiencing any problems! This app is even better than Kik because on kik it takes forever for the other person to receive your message while on UppTalk the person receives the message the second after you hit send. I have one suggestion though. This app would be better if you could video call people as well\, not just audio. Other than that this app is perfection!

7779,I originally loved this app because it allowed me to have a real number as well as text messaging. However\, my app is completely crazy it freezes all the time even though I have awesome wifi signal\,and there is some weird cross line thing that happens when your on a call for approximately 20mins or longer there is a horrible static noise\,and a faded signal noise as well. In addition I love upptalk \,and all the perks that come with it \,but I am not happy with the amount of freezing and cross line noises I feel like other individuals are intruding on my conversation\,and vice versa. Futhermore\, I would love it if there was some type of update that allowed apple ringtones to be used with paying\,and changes made to the amount of freezing and cross lines. #i love upptalk,US,2014-07-30 07:44:00,3,Ascony,New update!!!,426224730,

7884,The part that works is fine\, but after four days with no reply to my request for help with a problem (via their official web site)\, I'm very disappointed.  I guess 'you get what you pay for' is never truer than when you are ignored by your provider.  I'll keep it\, but I won't count on it\, and I certainly won't invest any more into it.  Buying something that is a bit more professional and costs a bit more is a better bet.,US,2014-04-18 04:41:00,3,SDinsf,Great as long as it works\, but don't expect any help.,426224730,

7887,There isn't a dial pad during calls\, and voicemail needs a complete overhaul (no way to change outgoing msg\, VMs only play on speakerphone).  Fix these features\, and I'll change my rating to 5 stars.With google voice going away soon\, a lot of us will need a viable alternative.  This might become my go-to app\, when/if the dial pad (during calls) and voicemail issues are fixed.,US,2014-04-15 15:44:00,2,idioteque555,Desperately needs to add basic features,426224730,

8451,This app is absolutely phenomenal. The app itself works just as well as Uber\, but I have found taxi drivers know how to get around the city much better than Uber drivers. No surge pricing either.,US,2014-11-21 06:35:00,5,Ari T.,Use code P3NF4K for $10 off,584165682,

8453,I use a variety of app based ride companies to get around SF for work\, and thus far Flywheel has consistently offered my the best experience. I love the fact that I can reliably get a clean taxi\, with a driver who knows where they are going\, and who can get me to my destination on time. Also the fact that I no longer have to worry about pulling out my wallet at the end of the ride or stress about holding up traffic when I get out is a big plus. If I had to describe my experience in one word: seamless.,US,2014-11-12 00:35:00,5,Manbearpigtigerwolfjuice,Best taxi experience.,584165682,
8454,Not happy that the last review I left got nuked because the user name I chose was taken. Trying to support the licensed taxi industry. Usually easier to get a taxi on the street unless calling from home. Not very impressed.,US,2014-11-08 08:56:00,2,Attempt number two,Underwhelmed,584165682,
8455,At first I couldn't how using Flywheel made getting a taxi so much easier.  But consistency is key to a reliable transportation App in a big city.  Regrettably this one has some bugs : sometimes the App works and sometimes it doesn't\, sometimes the GPS works\, other times not so much.  They need a quality control and quality assurance team\, not just reviews.  I'll say this it beats Yellow Cab.,US,2014-11-01 21:52:00,3,Mushi Peppertree,Needs work!,584165682,
8456,I've used flywheel ten times now and it is great. I get a cab where I need it when I need it. And call me old-fashioned\, but I like the fact my driver knows the City\, gets paid a living wage\, is insured\, and has health benefits too.,US,2014-10-28 03:52:00,5,Gumbo8566,Works Well!,584165682,
8457,Flywheel is a great way to do a quick comparison for rates. When uber and lyft have surges\, I can get a cab just as easily for almost half the price.  The app itself is easy to use and understand.,US,2014-10-16 15:38:00,4,Scott Weese,Good way to keep costs down,584165682,

8461,Every time I open the app\, the wait time is 5 times longer than Uber. Then the app has a 5 min delay to notify you of your cab\, forcing you to wait outside. The cabs often reek of cigarettes\, and unlike Uber drivers\, take the slowest routes. Also\, rates are 2.5 times that of Uber.,US,2014-10-09 06:36:00,1,caseydilla,The Worst,584165682,
8462,Flywheel is bringing the taxi industry into the. 21st century. Our cab arrived on time. The driver was helpful and courteous. He was experienced and professional. Booked yesterday for the airport. Easy!,US,2014-10-01 14:29:00,5,shapes68,Great,584165682,
8463,I attempted to use Flywheel several times in San Francisco and both times the difference between the 'estimated time' and actual time is significant (+ 5-15 minutes). Also\, when I cancelled the trip (due to severe wait times) they charged my card $2.00.I believe Flywheel is Yellow Cab's attempt at staying relevant and they're failing.,US,2014-09-30 13:33:00,1,mc_CLOUD,Fraudulent Service,584165682,

8466,The taxi thing is really outdated. I had to get a ride from UCLA to my place which is about 1 mile\, it was late without traffic and it was $15.

8467,Definitely my favorite and most affordable mode of transportation when I am getting to and from work\, the airport\, or a late night gathering in Seattle.

8470,Combined with Flywheel\, taxi drivers are the fastest\, fastest way to get where you are going in San Francisco—they know all the shortcuts and they can use the taxi lanes. No futzing with GPS. Plus they all have commercial insurance. If you get in an accident with one of those “rideshare” people\, you’re screwed. I’ll stick with the professionals\, thank you!,US,2014-09-23 04:32:00,5,mrs.eaves,so fast\, great drivers,584165682,

8472,First things first when using the apps price calculator make sure to input the zip codes of the addresses. I just experienced major issues with this app. I went to the taxi companies website to get a price quote and was satisfied with there quote so I used the app. When I got to my destination the price I was charged was quite a bit different than what the company quoted me for. After contacting the app about this issue they sent me a link to there calculator telling me they changed there pricing even though it does not state that in the app anywhere. I went to there calculator and imputed my pick up and drop off without the zip codes and got the price the app charged me\, however when I added the zip codes into there calculator with the same exact addresses I expected to see the same price. I did not get the same price and instead was quoted a cheaper price when adding the zip codes. I would recommend against getting this app.,US,2014-09-07 23:40:00,1,CaptChron,False price quotes,584165682,
8473,I've used uber and lyft before\, both companies were great and did exactly what they said. I ordered flywheel\, they show up with an outsourced cab company and the guy 'conveniently' forgot to start the meter for flywheel... Once we got to our destination\, demanded cash and said that my promotion code wouldn't work. I suggest that flywheel shouldn't outsource their cabs and actually hire their own dependable staff/drivers.,US,2014-09-07 06:52:00,1,Zackvs,Service,584165682,

8482,It may work for a short while then it doesn't. I'm on AT&T and was told for some reason flywheel has some contractual obligation to sprint t mobile and Verizon.

8483,This app summons cabs for ya. Don't be a jerk and order one\, grow impatient and hail one down as you wait\, as I was tempted to do. The map/ cab icon page doesn't refresh so it's a bit frustrating to see an estimated time and car not move closer.

8489,This was advertised as an easier way to get a cab; frankly\, this app only complicated things. I have no idea why it needed me to establish a 'set tip' or why it required that I give out my credit card number (especially when I prefer to use cash). I only wanted it to hail cabs (and to use the promo card that I was given to save a few bucks). This app was extremely disappointing. Great concept\, but the execution is so flawed that no one would ever want to use it.,US,2014-07-20 23:34:00,1,Mz. Tiggiewinkle,Awful!,584165682,

8492,I switched to Flywheel recently from UberX\, and I've found that the drivers arrive much much faster and have a significantly better sense of how to get to my destination.I also like that you can send the driver a note before they arrive\, I live in kind of a confusing place (on top of a tunnel with the same name as the street below) and other drivers get lost every time. Never had a problem with Flywheel.,US,2014-07-15 16:45:00,5,Capparis Spinosa,I love Flywheel!,584165682,
8493,It doesn't work here in Reno\, NV where three very large can companies reside and where we service people from all over the world for various sporting and convention events all year long!  Not to mention\, as a 24/7 town\, it would be nice to have a ride for if you want to have an evening entertaining yourself and don't want to drive if having a few cocktails.

8494,Has never EVER worked. I can see on the map that I'm surrounded by cabs. My account and payment info are correct. I tap to get assigned a cab. The app searches for drivers. Then I get a message that says\, 'We're having trouble locating a cab right now. Please try again.' Then I go onto Uber\, and boom! I'm in a car in less than 5 minutes.

8501,I have used this service repeatedly since I heard about it. In SF it works perfectly. No more waiting without knowing whether you will be able to get home on time.

8505,I was running late for work and had a promo code for Flywheel so I set up this app quickly. Requested a cab and it got me a guy in 2 minutes\, who was really nice. I don't think the reviews concerning drivers are fair; that has nothing to do with the app\, especially since it uses different cab companies (at least in SF). I had no GPS problem either.,US,2014-05-27 15:33:00,5,heckvetica,Worked perfectly,584165682,
8506,Needs a password. I give it. Doesn't accept it. Worthless. Deleted with haste.,US,2014-05-26 06:35:00,1,68421814,Worthless,584165682,
8507,1) did not work at 3am\, even though the app showed several cabs available on the same block2) claimed I had promo credit\, and then billed me for the full amount and said the credit had been usedOverall very disappointing\, especially considering the alternatives.,US,2014-05-25 18:41:00,1,Raymond Zhong,Multiple negative experiences,584165682,
8508,I have requested a cab several times through this app. Every single time I have requested a cab the GPS is off and I tried to contact the driver. Then I get sent to customer service who says there is no driver en route for me. Of course\, customer service is absolutely of no help and says there is nothing they can do. One even transferred me to 'technical support' and then says 'oh it's the weekend\, they don't work then.'  So essentially\, the driver doesn't get a cab fare and I don't get picked up. Don't use this app or company. Stick to uber or lyft. Tried to give a start up a chance and they failed miserably.,US,2014-05-25 08:07:00,1,Acs258574&393,ABSOLUTE WORST APP EVER,584165682,
8509,It should win the price for the worst app designed to ease transportation. The guy that picked us up wasn't even friendly like most other car services apps. Didn't want to use his GPS and I ended up using my phone. The ironic thing is that the destination was only blocks away so for him to be a cab driver and be lost within such a short distance is just a shame. And the ride was not cheap either.,US,2014-05-23 19:50:00,1,Ipaleblon,Worst Car Service App,584165682,
8510,Nice app and certainly a big step up from hailing cab or calling a dispatcher. I think the strong point of this app is the sheer number of taxis available. Of course\, the app still relies on taxi drivers. I still get the occasional unpleasant\, rude driver. But the ability to choose the tip amount helps. Some other taxi apps don't let you do that. Also\, rating the drivers after a ride is key. Although\, I'd like to see the driver's rating. A plus with taxi drivers is that at least they're typically very knowledgable about the area and know how to get to your destination quickly.  Payment is quick and easy. Just hop out of the cab at the end of your trip and that's it! I get confirmation on my phone within seconds.,US,2014-05-22 16:04:00,5,CalifDude,Great for getting a cab,584165682,
8511,No pre-planning trips\, so I made sure to get up early and request on time. Tried a few times and got errors ('having trouble\, sorry')\, so I used Taxi Magic instead\, which worked flawlessly. That app also let's you order a taxi in the future. I tried this app for the $5 credit\, totally not worth it. Sorry :(,US,2014-05-20 15:21:00,1,Noah Richards,Problems in the Seattle area,584165682,
8512,It's a good service.. It just feels a little bit more expensive. I could be wrong. Plus\, the selling point was that these would be experienced drivers that did not have to use GPS. But when I got in the flywheel cabs\, they have needed GPS both times.

8529,I live in Seattle and have been using Flywheel on and off since they launched sometime last year.  In that time\, the app has just been getting better and better.  The new design is extremely functional and super easy - open the app\, it finds where you are\, touch a couple of buttons to hail\, and a cab arrives minutes later.  The ETA is accurate\, and all of the cabs I’ve been in are very clean and the drivers polite. Give it a shot!,US,2014-04-07 16:33:00,5,jomok33,No surge and the new design is super easy to use!

8535,I love the new look of the Flywheel app! I took one ride with the new version and it worked beautifully. I’m an avid Flywheel user and it’s never let me down. I love the fact that all the drivers are insured and it is lightning fast to get a ride. I highly recommend using Flywheel to anyone who lives in San Francisco.,US,2014-03-26 06:01:00,5,Dave94054,I LOVE this app,584165682,

8540,If you want to compete with Uber\, you fare splitting built into the app. Also\, it would be nice if you could rate your drivers at the end. I've had horrible experiences with Flywheel drivers which is why I use Uber instead. They have a rating system so I know exactly what I'm getting into.,US,2014-03-20 23:25:00,3,Brian Claire,Lacking.,584165682,

8542,The drivers are okay. But one time I was late for work and the diver answered but didn't move for 2 minutes. according to the GPS. The 'call driver' button never worked for me. Also there is no way to check your trip history. What's up with that? I need the info to record my work related expenses. I have Lyft but I can never get anyone in the Sunset.,US,2014-03-13 22:47:00,3,亻壬亻可,Good and bad,584165682,

8544,Flywheel has a lot of work to do. Asking for reviews when I'm trying to find a cab quickly should have been obviously a mistake. The gps is very erratic\, but the estimates are not as bad - my driver showed up right away while his dot was across the city.,US,2014-03-06 03:48:00,1,bsdfm,Drivers are great; app has a lot of work to do,584165682,

8548,I'm a new customer. Tried requesting the cab on two different occasions but both during a peak usage (events in the city). First time it drained my battery within minutes while pinging the drivers and second time it got stuck in 'request the ride' mode and failed to cancel when I tried. I had to turn off cellular network so it would stop contacting drivers! It made me worry my credit card will be charged a fine. I'll try again on a less busy day but please try to improve your surge handling.,US,2014-02-05 19:10:00,3,zpoint,App can't handle high traffic,584165682,
8549,It's very easy and convenient to use. You can hail a cab from wherever you and you can pay and tip without lifting a finger. I used it for the first time on vacation in Seattle. I can't wait to use it again when I get home to the Bay Area :),US,2014-02-02 15:35:00,5,Nessg1,Love this app!,584165682,

8551,Whether or not you like taxis or amateurs is a different story. :)My normal flow is to try flywheel first (especially with surge pricing) and fall back to the other services when necessary.,US,2014-01-29 16:31:00,5,Eric391,The app itself is solid.,584165682,
8552,Since flywheel goes through many cab companies\, the availability is through the roof. Super-easy to use. I love the ability to select a nearby business as the pick-up point!

8557,Currently in SF there seems to be a very high ratio of flywheel cabs on the road to customers as flywheel has grown a lot\, probably in at least 80% of our cabs now. Give the app a few minutes to find a driver if it is not instant\, but once you get one\, we will show up or else we are logged out for many hours. Never are there any surge prices and with so many flywheel cabs now I get much less calls\, the ones I do get are within a block or two. I assume flywheel for the customers in SF is working very nicely\, often coming as quick as our rivals... Plus Lyft\, Sidecar and of course Uber ALL charge surge prices now\, so on a weekend\, we are your cheapest ride in town. Happy that flywheel is growing into the universal taxi dispatch of San Francisco\, give it a try.,US,2014-01-18 06:04:00,5,a little gay fella,From a flywheel driver,584165682,

8559,The first time we used it we couldn't get anyone to accept the request\, despite multiple attempts\, but we were at the Golden Gate Bridge at 5p on a Friday.  I supposed you'd have to contact the dispatcher for the cab company directly in this case. Otherwise it worked very well on several later uses. One of the nicest features is the auto charge to your credit card but this comes at the expense of the $1 convenience fee. The emailed receipts are nice for expense reports.,US,2014-01-11 18:49:00,4,Pat_ERMD,No guaranteed ride!,584165682,

8573,Used this to get to airport after discovering it about an hour before leaving. Everything worked flawlessly.

8577,First\, the service - I've used it twice in Seattle\, where Flywheel routes it to East Side for Hire or Flat Rate for Hire.  The cabbies were prompt and courteous\, and the price was lower than Uber (there is no UberX in Seattle yet). Then there's the app. It's fine\, such as it goes\, but it's not as good as Uber. There's no way to message the driver (although they can call you) and there's no way to get an estimate before committing to a ride. Still\, it worked and the price was right.,US,2013-11-17 22:30:00,3,Time Warner Minion,Good value in Seattle,584165682,

8579,I've been a power user of this app since it was cabulous\, however\, Flywheel is letting too many drivers onto their system who don't know what they're doing and often abuse the 'call fare' button to the point that the app is counterintuitive.

8583,Great potential\, but 'no go' after paying an obligatory per ride surcharge (understandable for convenience of using this service) then complaining to customer service about drivers charging the next higher fare after the 'arrival' meter read--who in turn does nothing to address the issue other than remind me that I can lower the tip if I catch it within a few minutes of completion (ah\, yeah\, too late for that\, any other suggestions?). Rather pay more for Uber than play the tip deduction game.,US,2013-11-08 17:21:00,1,Poww!,Disappointing customer service,584165682,

8585,Über and Lyft don't reach out to my area\, so I can't compare to them\, but compared to the only other alternatives (Taxi Magic or calling the dispatcher) this app is a DREAM. The difference is entirely in how they deal with the taxi drivers. Taxi Magic dealt with the local taxi companies\, and the drivers never stopped resenting them. FlyWheel is dealing with the drivers and seems to be treating them well\, as I've yet to get the “Can you please pay some other way?” dance when using FlyWheel. The apps are comparable\, but the integration with the legacy cab infrastructure is way better with FlyWheel.

8593,I've been using Flywheel for a long time\, since it first began as Cabulous. It's the only way I get a cab any more - it's fast\, reliable\, and very easy to use\, even on my dinosaur phone. I love the map that tracks your cab and the ability to contact the driver. On those cold SF nights when it seems like everybody wants a cab\, it's the way I guarantee I actually get one.,US,2013-10-23 19:54:00,5,ShepSF,The only sure way to get a cab,584165682,

8601,My friend had a stroke and was in ICU at a hospital that is a ferry ride away into a big city. I got into the first cab I could wave down and asked the driver for a card because he was so courteous and the car was so clean. He gave me the Flywheel card and I looked the app up in iTunes. Trial run was amazing! They were at the hospital to pick me up 1 minute after I selected a cab needed! I hope this sticks around!

8604,After you request a ride\, always received message that all drivers were busy. Then you get the option to try again or cancel.

8608,Tried this app twice. First time\, no one responded to my pickup request. Waited 30 minutes before giving. Second time it took 20 minutes for a cab to arrive.

8620,I have had several good experiences with the current version of Flywheel. My one concern is that sometimes am available can will show up at a couple of blocks away\, but will drive the wrong direction or pass your general location and keep on going\, because they actually have a passenger that they are dropping off nearby before getting you. This is understandable from the drivers' perspective\, but can result on a longer wait than you thought you were signing up for when hailing the cab. Wish there was something that could be done about that.,US,2013-08-09 08:52:00,4,Matt Springer,Good but take locations with a grain of salt,584165682,
8621,The app is generally fine\, however it's unclear how much of the sluggishness is because the drivers are distracted by existing fares or because the app has issues. My biggest problem is that the drivers are completely unreliable. It is very clear that the drivers are accepting Flywheel fares while still completing current trips. Nearly every time you will see a bevy of cabs in your area\, select hail\, and then wait 30-60 seconds for one to accept. He's 2 minutes away\, sweet! Haha\, just kidding\, why don't you watch as he drives 5-10 minutes the opposite direction before turning around to come get you. Very clear he was making a drop but accepted your hail anyway. 2 min becomes 10-15 very quickly\, meanwhile that Über you could have hailed would have actually arrived in 2 min. I only use Flywheel when there are zero Uber/Uberx in my area\, and even then I usually have better luck just walking to a corner and waiting to hail a cab.,US,2013-08-08 05:17:00,2,TAvzw,Slow and unreliable\, but usually there when you need 'em,584165682,
8622,Support had me create a new ID their database messed up my account so much. With the second ID\, the app is stuck in adding and declining my credit card.

8640,Why change it to quick cab?? Because I can get a cab very quickly! Especially those late night after the bar hopping when I'm in no condition to drive home\, every time I use this app\, the cab is here in 2-3 minutes even when there's a bunch of people trying to get a cab in SF! My credit card info is in it any it has never been used by other people or my info hasn't been stolen\, so I dunno what's all the negative reviews are about.The new update version 4.0 is awesome! It's VERY straight forward app\, as simple as choosing a destination to get picked up\, the cab picks you up\, and BAM you're at your next destination without needing to even whip out your wallet,US,2013-05-30 02:32:00,5,Iyell4icecream,Should change the name to quick cab,584165682,
8641,I am obsessed with this app! I've had amazing success at hailing cabs - and for no premium. I used to use Über but it was so expensive and seemingly increasingly so. Flywheel is WAY better!

8647,The UI is pretty good and my first couple of experiences went well. Unfortunately\, the last few times I've tried to use it no cabs accepted the pick up. It would appear there are plenty of cabs within one to three minutes but at busy times of day they have no motivation to pick app users up because they'd prefer cash and that's not an option here.

8657,This app really grinds my gears! I stayed with Cabulous until they deactivated that app\, and have been using flywheel every morning to get work for about 2 weeks now. There's no confirmation screen on my side for the payment\, and if I hit cancel in order to try to pay with cash\, the driver can still charge me through the app. I've only seen the screen where I assign a tip a couple of times. Is that because the driver doesn't tap a certain button? Who knows! I just want Cabulous back!,US,2013-04-15 13:59:00,2,Sonya Deters,Unreliable!,584165682,
8658,A friend recommended Flywheel and it worked beautifully.I got two cabs last night and in both cases\, the driver arrived within 1-2 minute of my request.  I was able to track their progress on a map\, was notified when they arrived\, and just walked out of the cab and it automatically billed me. I LOVE Flywheel and am looking forward to using it for all my cab rides in the city!,US,2013-04-11 20:13:00,5,Budha294,Worked beautifully,584165682,
8659,1. The GPS does not update the location of the driver\, so you can't get a sense of whether your cab is still on the way2. Regardless of how many cabs there are very close by on the map\, the one that eventually picks up the hail is typically quite far away - should just show the ones that are available or willing to actually participate on this app3. Most cabs don't pick up the phone of you call them4. Twice a cab was on route\, and then after several calls the cab told me that they didn't want to come get me anymore. Didn't even bother canceling though the app. 5. More of an inconvenience but pretty standard on every other app is the ability to store common used or recently used locationsWith so many options this app should try harder to compete,US,2013-04-11 17:36:00,1,Jnaenay,Terrible app\, try anything else,584165682,
8660,After I downloaded the app\, attached my credit card to it\, and used it a couple times to pay drivers\, my card started being declined in every cab not called through Flywheel. Worked in all other retailers\, just not cabs. AND: the charge actually went through and posted to my account (sometimes multiple times)\, although it showed up as 'declined''on the cabbie's end. Had to cancel that card and get a new one\, which is incredibly annoying. Also\, some of the cabbies are vocally crabby about people who use Flywheel. I know\, they shouldn't use the service then. And why aren't you emailed a receipt??,US,2013-04-11 13:37:00,2,lkim27705,Coincidence?,584165682,

8662,I was a daily user of this app\, now it glitches\, double charges\, and the drivers themselves don't know a thing about the service. Flywheel got greedy. Game over.,US,2013-04-09 23:40:00,1,bmansell,Flywheel,584165682,

8664,Taxis are few and far between in most of San Francisco so I use flywheel a lot. I'm always stuck between restaurants and bars in rando neighborhoods. Flywheel is faster and easier than uber and the drivers are awesome.,US,2013-04-09 21:21:00,5,Thejulia,Flywheel = life saver,584165682,

8666,Pretty slimy to force the download of the new version\, and then to sneak in the forced payment by credit card with no more option to pay cash. Pretty sure that was the planned transition all along. Would have been much more respectable to put that out in the open (from the beginning)\, as other companies do. Upside: app/service has worked well so far.,US,2013-04-07 18:32:00,2,staydetuned,Underhanded,584165682,

8668,I love this app! Super convenient with a much wider base of cab companies than Über or TaxiMagic – means I'm more likely to get a cab quickly. I do have two new feature requests though – being able to pre-book cabs\, and being able to choose a cash payment instead of my card on file.Highly recommend this app for cabs\, especially here in SF!,US,2013-04-06 18:12:00,5,cartdawg,Great\, convenient app!,584165682,
8669,This app has crashed and frozen almost every time I've used it which is at least 10 times.  Now they're charging for it.  If there was a better alternative I'd be using it.  Sad state of affairs.,US,2013-04-06 13:36:00,1,Bstetter,Cabulous was great.  Flywheel not so much,584165682,

8672,Well\, I was forced to download the new version. The only noticeable innovation is that you can now ONLY pay by credit card. But\, it just kept crashing. First while loading the app and then while searching for a driver--5 times. I gave up.,US,2013-04-05 16:09:00,1,noddy-o,Unstable--and you have no choice,584165682,
8673,The app flywheel is not working. What a not an intelligent idea to stop the old one(cabulous) today\, which was working great. Plus- another limiting idea is to request as demand a credit card. It is our right as customers to have an option how to pay.,US,2013-04-05 15:32:00,1,acquarelli,Please return the old one back,584165682,
8674,Before I order a cab\, the app tells me the nearest cab is 5 minutes away. After I order a cab\, the app tells me the cab will arrive in 15 minutes. This has happened several times now. Bait and switch!,US,2013-03-29 16:21:00,1,Basil Crow,Bait and switch,584165682,

8676,Tried it for first time. Assigned cab that was 2 blocks away and it then proceeded to drive farther and farther away. Tried to cancel after several minutes of it heading in wrong direction and was threatened with cancellation fee. Tried calling but only got routed to flywheel voicemail. Ended up canceling since I was going to be late to meeting and BETTER not see a cancel fee on my cc!!  Worst first experience\, not sure I'd try again.,US,2013-02-26 18:15:00,1,Essenceq,First impressions hard to correct,584165682,
8677,Had to get to Valentine's Day dinner. App said nearest driver was 'less than a minute away'. Hit 'pick up'. App said 'Sorry\, all our drivers are busy'. Nice. Used InstantCab next\, picked up in 2min.,US,2013-02-15 01:58:00,1,3seat,Complete failure,584165682,
8678,I use to like cabulous\, but flywheel is not as good.  First of all cabs can say they are coming for you then cancel at the last minute.  But if I cancel a cab I get charged a fee.  Also the experience for both the user and the cab driver is confusing.  We sat in the cab for 5 minutes waiting for the credit card to go through after a complicated process.,US,2013-01-27 18:05:00,1,Sheltorme,Better off hailing a cab,584165682,
8679,whats the point of adding my credit card info to the app if drivers cant charge the fare directly to my card.  such a hassle.,US,2013-01-21 18:18:00,1,Toowan,driver asked me to pay manually,584165682,
8680,Give us the option to at least check out your app before requiring us to enter cc info. Deleted.,US,2013-01-04 18:11:00,1,arokeee,Requires credit card,584165682,
8681,Works great in Daytona Beach! I've been using Flywheel (Cabulous) for 6 months and Yellow Cab has always picked me up within 5 minutes of placing my pickup order. Nice drivers\, great rate and clean cabs with Yellow Cab - I can't say that about the other taxi companies in the area\, that's why finding Flywheel was a dream come true. The other added benefits; placing an order with the cab nearest you and not needing to go through dispatch (it's just quicker) and now with mobile payment I don't even need my wallet! Thank you\, Yellow Cab & Flywheel!To bad people can't read or they would realize that Flywheel only works in areas that existing taxi companies have partnered with Flywheel. They're not in every city\, only those listed on their website. And to all those complaining about having to input your credit card info\, it's for your convenience and a small payment if you cancel on the driver - who spent their time & gas to pick you up.,US,2012-12-26 22:12:00,5,Izooks,Yellow Cab Daytona uses Flywheel,584165682,
8682,This app is awesome!  I requested a pickup and a driver was at my door within minutes.  I was initially doubtful since it was raining outside and taxis in SF are virtually impossible to find in the rain\, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I even paid with my phone and the receipt was emailed to me\, which made it very easy to submit for my expense report.  All in all\, Flywheel is quick and efficient for grabbing a ride.,US,2012-12-25 08:05:00,5,Dave RCA-Jr,true shortcut,584165682,
8683,Thought it would be like uber but cheaper\, but drivers kept canceling or ending up to be 'too busy' to pick me up. Very unreliable. Might have to stick with uber for now,US,2012-12-21 01:20:00,2,Retepgnad1,Not reliable,584165682,
8684,1. Cannot book cans with this app where I live (DC area)2. I assumed\, since its asking for my card details\, I can use this app for booking right away3. Once i realized app is of no use\, I realized i cannot delete the card I added.I wish the app itself was a little more new user friendly in terms of making the user aware of which cities it operates in. I don't read the full app description on the app store before installing :-/I'd hate to delete the app since I cannot  delete the card details :(,US,2012-12-20 16:45:00,1,a non techie,Useless,584165682,
8685,I waited 40 minutes\, and the cab never came. When I called the driver\, he claimed he wasn't even located in the same city as me. Every time I checked\, the cab was tracking towards me just a few minutes away\, which gave me the false impression that the cab was almost there... So frustrating! I gave up and took the bus instead,US,2012-12-19 06:11:00,2,QL1555,Inaccurate - waste of time,584165682,

8689,Big fan of the Flywheel app. All of my gripes with the old app have been fixed (mainly the missing cab #) and the user experience is much better overall. Love the fact that I can pay with my CC\, so even though you have to enter in the #\, when you get your statement it's not nearly as bad as uber!,US,2012-12-17 05:14:00,5,Beachland1855,Great upgrade!,584165682,

8692,It's a bit odd to have to enter your credit card information as a first step to using an app. I tried using the app three times yesterday in San Francisco and it never worked. Now I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I have an app that has potential with my credit card information on hand but so far has never worked. Tricky.,US,2012-12-16 16:30:00,1,C_nolen13,A bit odd...,584165682,
8693,Why forcing people to enter their credit card number? How can I trust an app that I never used...,US,2012-12-15 21:17:00,1,thierrysf,I don't enter my CC to any random app,584165682,
8694,I never had good experience with cabs and still is! Rude! Not clean! Drive like only one on the road! All taxis are similar like Christmas tree lighting. So can't really tell which one is my ride! I have to go ask the drivers if his the one to pick me...? Otherwise I'll hop in to wrong cab. Somehow they are pricy than Über. Not sure why or how. I've tried Uber also Flywheels both from home to work and Flywheel charged me $3.67 higher than Über did. It's not a lot of money but that's how sleazy they are as usual. Cab companies should've done this Flywheel thing long time ago instead of waiting for Uber to get all the royalty from passenger like us. Über took all the cab business from them already because of their rude no English phone dispatchers and crazy drivers...,US,2012-12-14 07:18:00,1,Aminamuna,Lol,584165682,
8695,Used it to get to the airport tonite - flying out of sfo. Worked well even during evening rush hour.

8698,What I love about Flywheel isn't just the simple\, clean design of the app. It's the service behind the software. The trouble for all affordable ground transit apps has been the reliability and quality of the ride.  Flywheel seems to have solved this somehow. I'm finally confident that my driver is going to show up and give me a great ride...at an affordable price.,US,2012-12-13 14:34:00,5,Jwolpert,The app is the fleet,584165682,

8701,Don't have to look around on a busy night for a cab when everyone else is scrambling around.  Just relax and watch them come get me.  Love paying through my phone - no more cash or pulling out my wallet!,US,2012-12-13 05:02:00,5,Mr$$bags,Great way to get a cab!,584165682,
8702,It usually takes me about a half an hour to hail a cab in the Marina during rush hour but with Flywheel it only took me 5 minutes to find and hail a cab\, and I don't have to worry about carrying cash since my credit card is already linked to my account! Awesome experience! My go-to app to hail a cab. I highly recommend!,US,2012-12-13 05:02:00,5,Ruru225,AMAZING APP AND SERVICE,584165682,

12455,Generally a good app but there are several areas where it could be improved. First and most important\, it sometimes gives up almost immediately in trying to find a taxi\, which sort of defeats the purpose of the app. The zoom level of the map when you're waiting for the taxi to arrive at the pickup point needs some refinement to the algorithm\, particularly if there is a wide distance between the pickup and drop off points. If you zoom in manually\, it zooms back out every time it refreshes the taxi's position. Would be better if it did not override a user's manual zoom. Its method of finding places for you pick as the start and stop points is a bit crude. The names of the locations also get cut off of they're too long to fit on one line\, so it can be a bit of trial and error to get the right one. It would helpful if one could simply enter an address directly. I've also noticed that on the taxi driver's display\, (sometimes) only the street address shows up\, which is not helpful in Singapore. It's also odd when I'm selecting the pickup point by condo name on my end\, which means there is a disparity between what the app is showing me and what it's showing the driver. Also needs an update for the iPhone 6 and 6+ as the keyboard is clunky when entering your searches. Still not good enough at identifying destinations.,US,2014-12-29 10:14:00,3,jam9999,Decent but flawed,647268330,

12459,Usually I take Über but I thought I would give their premium 'GrabCar' service a try.PISS POOR SERVICE&EXPENSIVEI would pay a bit more for even more premium service\, but the service was sub-par.  Driver had an attitude and didn't know how to speak in the polite form of the Thai language.  I am a non-native speaker of Thai and I was offended.  Why should I pay double of what I usually pay for Über?  This service is NOT recommended.  I'll walk before I use this horrible service ever again.,US,2014-12-27 05:33:00,1,Usmc2049,Horrible,647268330,
12460,Everytime I ve got to catch a taxi\, I will use Grab app rather than normal way by contacting to a taxi company in order for them to assign a cab for me\, because it takes too long.

Crazy. No wonder I've been having no-shows many times. Concept is faulty because it assigns cab in a straight line distance although by road may take 20x longer even without traffic. Cabbie is also able to accept job before dropping off current passenger who may alight at a far away place. This will explain inaccurate times given. Where it said 2 mins to arrive\, it usually took 30-45 minutes. Certainly not a reliable booking service especially when time is short. Stick to apps where driver is able to manually input the time and empty cab.I believe most of these positive reviews are planted.,US,2014-11-27 07:38:00,1,Mommyof2QTPi,Not for those in a hurry,647268330,

12518,Amazing app. You book a taxi on your phone. You get assigned a driver. The app tells you what the driver's license plate number is so you know which is your taxi. You can see on a real time map where the driver is. There is a booking fee\, but even if you flag down a taxi on the street you pay an extra fee. I like this app!,US,2014-11-13 22:47:00,5,Radzin,Awesome,647268330,
12519,The biggest benefit that Heilo or EasyTaxi have over GrabTaxi is the others' ability to make direct payments using a credit card stored on the profile.

12524,This works great in the Philippines.  I hope they would increase the number of taxis that can bid at a time. I almost always just get 5. I've used this app more than 15 times and quite a number of drivers are complaining about your service (to them) which is quite concerning.

12583,Grab services changed. I'm always late for school because it takes too long to get a cab. Sometimes their drivers cancel if they have to wait for 5mins. Which is unfair. We (customers) have to wait for them to arrive at our location that takes them 10 mins or more and they cant wait for 5 mins for their passengers? And their customized cabs (sexy fox\,moose\,etc.) its for free yeah thats great but you get to ride them how many times? Uh\, once? They should provide more. And their base fare plus 70? Too much!! Not all filipinos can afford 70 pesos added to their fares excluding the 40 pesos based fare. I'm really disappointed.

You can add extra info like 'NETS payment only and the drivers pay attention to the additional info (not like some others) Cannot  recommend highly enough.

12602,They say GT offers transparency and safety.  So when the driver shows up in a car with a different plate number\, that defeats that purpose.  They say GT offers excellent drivers.

12606,The ability to connect directly to nearby drivers and get their precise location and arrival time makes this app very useful. I am a frequent Uber user as well\, and this app has all the features of Uber\, but with local cab prices. I have had it work even in the rain\, when (as most Singaporeans will know) all other booking apps that go through the cab companies fall apart.

He went down the cab banged the door while still cursing me while we were stuck in the traffic. I am pregnant by the way! When I was about 150meters from the gate of my house\, he wanted me to go down the cab and walk. WHY? BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR HIM TO GO BACK TO OUT GUARDHOUSE WHEN INFACT IT WAS SO EASY TO JUST TURN AROUND! RUDE! RUDE! RUDE! DEFINITELY DELETING THIS APP! OVERCHARGED! DISRESPECTFUL TAXI DRIVERS!

12609,My life is so much easier with grab taxi!! Thanks so much for finally bringing singapore up to global standard!,US,2014-05-14 01:52:00,5,Johnkim610,Great app!!,647268330,
12610,More expensive than calling in a booking. Non transparent fee structure. Would not recommend!,US,2014-04-25 12:23:00,1,Req2104,Overpriced\, overcharged,647268330,
12611,Seems polished enough but when you say there are 18 cabs near by and show them I don't expect for it to then say 'there are no cabs'.,US,2014-04-23 11:01:00,2,ayman,Nice idea. Didn't work.,647268330,
12612,I like the UI and the ability to book all cab companies via one app.I dislike that:-I cannot book a favorite destination.- I get spammed via email for every taxi I book.,US,2014-04-15 12:52:00,3,HenryRoxas,Cool features\, but some basic limitations,647268330,
12613,I love this app!,US,2014-04-09 15:07:00,5,Sk1980887,My goto booking app in Singapore,647268330,
12614,The app itself works but whether a taxi will come on time or not at all is a gamble!! Sometimes no one takes your bid!! Just make sure you have a backup plan. I've had drivers who showed up an hour before time and a driver who didn't show up at all. Good thing I wasn't going to the airport or had an appointment!! The inconvenience is that you have to book it at least 2 hours ahead of time. If there's a problem\, customer service doesn't answer their phone... Just use cautiously!!,US,2014-04-05 11:16:00,2,Nissrine Houari-Tarik,Sometimes it works!!,647268330,
12615,Good idea\, but no point if the drivers ignore every time.Had success first time\, since then tried on THREE separate occasions.  Each time was ignored.Fyi\, using in Bangkok,US,2014-03-28 12:18:00,1,Kkositkun,Useless,647268330,
12616,I had booked a Taxi in advance and Taxi arrived on time\, very polite and they used the meter! Wonderful to avoid Taxi scams,US,2014-02-22 08:41:00,5,Elmago150,Excellent!!,647268330,
12617,First off\,  the app is incredibly bad at determining my starting location.  Let ME touch the map and drop an accurate pin.  I know where I am!Secondly\,  the app is useless if every taxi is just going to ignore it.  Every attempt to book a taxi consists of a long wait while multiple cars are being contacted and finally results in the message: 'Sorry\, we were unable to find you a taxi'.Useless.,US,2014-02-07 10:57:00,1,Obiofulious,Just doesn't work,647268330,
12618,Easy to use\, safe and very convenient!,US,2013-12-28 04:13:00,5,enuhski,Excellent,647268330,
12619,I haven't had much success lately in calling for cabs so when I saw this app\, I didn't really have high expectations. Friday afternoon\, around 4:30 pm\, I tried calling several cab companies but I couldn't get a cab so I tried using this app at the same time. In five minutes\, I was able to get a confirmed booking and in less than 10 mins\, the cab was at my location. And he already had my destination on his GPS! Ricky\, the driver\, was very polite and pleasant as well. Overall\, an excellent experience! ü,US,2013-12-19 09:03:00,5,atetj,Better than expected!,647268330,
12620,Been using this app more this December because of the promo for Globe Users. Thanks for waiving the booking fee. I hope you can extend this promo until end of December ,US,2013-12-08 18:13:00,5,SleepyGirl30,Very Convenient!,647268330,
12621,App crashes all the time after update,US,2013-11-24 07:23:00,1,Iiiiiiiiiiiii123,Crashes after update,647268330,
12622,Late night to get home\, needed a taxi and then i found this app and it worked very well! Plus i got a very honest driver\, very safe(even the way he drives)! I'm very satisfied with my first trial and i will definitely use it every time now. Thanks whoever made this app\,you made my worries about getting a taxi go away! 2 thumbs up!,US,2013-11-03 14:50:00,5,Mlasser,Very convenient!,647268330,
12623,Release tablet version. Some of us have 3G and 4G tablets. I will probably change my rating when I use the service.,US,2013-11-02 16:49:00,3,NoMadPH,I rated based on app\, not service,647268330,
12624,Great app for both passenger(s) and taxi driver(s),US,2013-10-17 20:46:00,5,nasgier,Great Application.,647268330,
12625,Second as a family we have used this service. This time the estimated time of arrival was at 0:00 yet no taxi. Waited for a few more minutes them flagged down a ride. Driver never showed so we canceled the service. Not sure if the drivers are excepting fares while they still have rides or not. I believe in the service an glad it is here. Just pray that drivers get more training. As your clientele will suffer if they don't.,US,2013-08-23 07:08:00,1,demacmaster,No Taxi,647268330,
12626,Don't rely on your phones GPS designated pick up location. Mine was off by several km. Type your location in the search field before using this app.  I don't think this is a problem with the app. Most likely a problem with the cellular system in Manila (big surprise).,US,2013-08-17 04:28:00,3,cnphoto,pickup location ?,647268330,

12628,A convenient app that allows me to get a taxi in the metro! Thank you! This should be implemented to all taxis! :),US,2013-07-31 05:37:00,5,SagaAbby,Awesome!,647268330,
12629,GPS locations of taxi booked are inaccurate... And your system with the drivers is not fool-proof...,US,2013-07-24 04:08:00,2,Arch. John,Needs improvement...,647268330,
12630,Very good as it gives you real time taxi information. The cabs selected are also clean and new. Things that need to be improved:- time field doesn't work. Cannot book taxis in advance. - there should be a phone number for grab taxi customer support.,US,2013-07-22 11:26:00,4,darkymark,Good but can be improved.,647268330,
12715,Whenever i go to log in on when i am on kohl's wifi it gives an an invalid refrsh token error and i cant log in. You get 10 points whenever yoh log in from their wifi but i havent gotten an for weeks because it wont let me log in.,US,2014-12-29 19:18:00,2,Yungxsi,Error Message,472014516,
12716,Just found out that the cashier must ask for your phone number when making an In store purchase in order to get points added To your account    I spent a great deal at kohls and not one cashier asked for this info to get my points added.  I was told to call customer service to give all my receipt numbers!   ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? How far back should I go!!!???  I am extremely disappointed with kohls on this regard.  Macy's \, target\, etc automatically record rewards points and they are printed on your receipt and your monthly statement. Kohls IT dept needs to correct this issue.  I AM NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER!!!,US,2014-12-28 20:06:00,1,Marieperfume,Not earning yes to you rewards points,472014516,
12717,I keep receiving an error prompt of 'invalid token' when I try I enter my Kohl's cash or other discounts. I expected a lot more from this app (at the very least that the app would function properly).,US,2014-12-28 17:13:00,1,Hondaguy9204,It would be great if it worked!,472014516,
12718,Can't scan kohls cash or anything else. The whole reason I downloaded the app.,US,2014-12-28 12:42:00,2,Gummball123,Great idea if it worked,472014516,
12719,After filling out information\, it tells me I am signed up for yes 2 you rewards but then it says I'm not. Tried multiple times. App will not allow me to scan barcode for rewards either. Ugh!!! Needs a lot of work/ fixes.,US,2014-12-27 13:22:00,1,Bffiswruvdzzz,Ugh!!!!,472014516,
12720,It would be helpful if the release notes somewhere showed why the app now requests access to motion activity... What is that used for?,US,2014-12-27 13:00:00,1,RickNY,Why does app request access to motion activity?,472014516,
12721,Been using this app for a while. The latest problem is you can't disconnect when you logout. Keeps saying it is using location services. Have to restart my phone!,US,2014-12-27 02:02:00,1,March Madness Maven,Won't disconnect when you logout,472014516,
12722,Only reason I got the app was to store my Kohl's cash which doesn't work in the app... Keep getting invalid token error. Deleting and moving on...,US,2014-12-25 20:55:00,1,Sean 11/9/12,Doesn't work on 6 plus,472014516,
12723,This is a good idea but you should make sure it works first. I just downloaded it and unfortunately did not read the reviews first. I can't even scan my Kohl's cash. I have an invalid token error that won't go away. Love Kohl's but this app needs major work.,US,2014-12-22 15:05:00,1,Danistitcher,Not a great app,472014516,
12724,Same negative results as other comments here.   Have lost all my points\, scanner does not work \, totally useless.  Kohls rewards was an incentive to shop but this new program is a disaster.,US,2014-12-21 20:34:00,1,KevGelay,Pathetic,472014516,
12725,App has serious glitches. The main reason I downloaded the app was so that I could scan all my discounts and Kohls cash into one place and just use my app in the store. It will not let you scan. Very disappointing. I will not be using this app.,US,2014-12-20 15:13:00,1,Samantha Phillips,Nice Idea,472014516,
12726,I'm not able to scan anything or find out any of my balances- the concept was great Kohl's but it was a big let down,US,2014-12-20 01:04:00,1,Big Kohl's shopper,This app doesn't work:(,472014516,
12727,At least give me the option\, I  don't want to have to enter my password every time I wan to review what I have in my wallet. My phone is secure with Touch ID\, if I can rely on Touch ID to secure my credit cards\, I can rely on it to secure my kohls coupons.,US,2014-12-19 21:43:00,3,Jon McDanel,Please make login permanent,472014516,

12731,Was forced to upgrade yesterday. Now I can't log into my Wallet or Yes rewards. So it's basically useless to me.,US,2014-12-17 00:06:00,1,LauraD111,Worked fine until new version,472014516,
12732,Why is no one paying attention to the fact that this app doesn't work? It won't keep you signed in when you attempt to use any function. What is the point? The updated app still doesn't work. It doesn't recognize Kohls cash when I scan it.,US,2014-12-16 20:51:00,1,Rochelle Greenberg,Awful App,472014516,
12733,Bought $250.00 worth of stuff at Kohl’s yesterday.  Tried to use my 25.0% off offer that came in a push for the “NEW” app.  Wouldn’t scan at the register.  Couldn’t manually enter.  Then the coupon just disappeared.  Had to go into my email\, find the coupon that had been emailed\, pull up the email and get the link.  People on line were NOT happy.  Thankfully\, the young lady at the register was very kind and didn’t lose her cool.,US,2014-12-16 18:41:00,1,Lakeview East,Still can’t access coupons/offers/reward…kills battery too,472014516,
12734,This app is finally getting to be useful.  The updates are helping it to work much better and I can now use it without frustration .  Keep up the good work and updates!!,US,2014-12-14 19:50:00,5,JustBelieve!,Keeps improving!,472014516,
12735,Initially I loved the Kohl's app. I liked how I didn't have to carry around my coupons or Kohl's cash. Not sure if this was a fluke or what but I noticed that when my Kohl's cash expired it automatically deleted it from my wallet. I was bummed bc most Kohl's stores still accept Kohl's cash despite it being expired. Had I known it was going to throw away my Kohl's cash without my prior knowledge I would've saved the actual Kohl's cash so I could've used it in person. I ended up deleting the app bc I was so upset. I won't be downloading it again unless they fix this glitch.,US,2014-12-14 18:04:00,2,Pugmom007,Just okay at best,472014516,
12736,Search never works so no sales here Kohl's is losing money,US,2014-12-14 01:22:00,1,rviskozki,No sale search doesn't work,472014516,
12737,I love the app it makes things so much easier to search things and shop.I love not having to look around in the store when I can search items up.,US,2014-12-14 00:46:00,5,Allaska Vazquez,GREAT,472014516,
12738,This app is so disappointing! First it doesn't save any usernames or passwords\, I understand the passwords\, but the usernames should be saved! If you jump around the app\, from your charge card\, rewards card\,and wallet\, each time you have to re type you're information. In the wallet function you're suppose to be able to scan in promos that come in the mail. But it displays a banner for a few seconds that says 'invalid token' and it doesn't scan! I'm on a iPhone 6 plus and the app may not be optimized for it!,US,2014-12-13 20:23:00,1,MIchaelLee71,Disappointing App,472014516,
12739,I love Kohls but this app is horrible. Always crashing and sending error messages. Also will not allow us to filter 'door buster' deals\, instead it makes you scroll through thousands and who has time for that. Please fix!!!,US,2014-12-13 14:21:00,1,Minnesotamamacakes,Not an improvement,472014516,
12740,I keep updating but keep getting a ' invalid token' message when tying to view my points/ rewards. It will not link my rewards to the app. If this was fixed I'd give 5 starts. I do like being able to store kohls cash and the only improvement besides this is it should link retail me not coupons sometimes it's slow to keep up with most recent savings,US,2014-12-12 22:44:00,4,Monicaredson,Love/hate relationship,472014516,
12741,Every time I log in using the app it tells me my yes2you rewards was inactive and has been recycled and to sign up again. I spent quite a while with 2 different reps on the phone who assured me on their end it was active. When I log in from my desk top compute it shows all my points and never has said that. Even checking on the mobile site it says inactive. This app is ok for shopping but the rewards section is messed up. Also I have 2 kohls accounts one is my husbands and I placed an order and I swore I selected my account for payment but it went on his.,US,2014-12-12 15:13:00,3,Justbeth82,Yes rewards has glitch,472014516,
12742,This is the only shopping app I have a problem with and it hasn't work for quite some time. Even after a few updates.....still something doesn't work. I wish it would work so I could use my Kohls cash before it expired and not have to save my email so they can scan my rewards card because the app never works. Highly disappointed in a store I love to shop at.,US,2014-12-11 06:30:00,1,Hardworkinggal123,Terrible.,472014516,
12743,Love kohl's but this app isn't what i expected of it.,US,2014-12-10 21:22:00,3,Shop till you,Hooper,472014516,
12744,Let me be clear: love the store\, love the service\, love the sales\, love the quality of the merchandise\, hate-hate-hate the frustratingly annoying constant crashing\, freezes at random app. It's been 4 weeks of attempts\, on wifi\, off wifi\, 3G\, 4G service\, close all other apps\, brand new IPhone 6plus\, Doesn't matter\, I can't think of any other ways I have not tried... I have never ever got far enough to make a single payment. It took about 20 tries to just log onto the credit card side\, then it just always crashes at the payment screen if it gets that far. It just seems peculiar an otherwise awesome company can produce such an amazingly bad app. Come on!!! I just want to pay my card? Why in the world are you making it so frustratingly hard to pay?? Even my local credit union who is about 1/100th smaller than Kohls annual revenue is able to create an app that works... And those guys work bankers hours! What gives?? I have downloaded countless free apps that have never crashed as frequently as this app. It's like the programmer made this app to crash just for the fun of it. And let's not forget it's only been the 30th time I've entered my user ID and password.... Nooooo\, please make my experience even more miserable by refusing to remember my userid. Please make me retype it all in again...(then crash).... Again... (Then crash).... Again....(nothing happens.... Then crash).... Again... Logged in!!!!... Click anywhere on the screen... It crashes. Welcome to 2014... Even  soviet Russia who's economy crashed has recovered and been to the moon and back... Ivan the penny chucker can chuck pennies at the customer service counter faster than this frustratingly super-crash\, (guaranteed to crash every time!!) app in paying my bills faster. Please\, please please... Hire a smarter monkey and re-write this payment app. It's only a few peanuts more.,US,2014-12-10 14:54:00,1,Wouyang,This app is worthless for making payments,472014516,
12745,Lovely first stab at an app. It would be great if your system synchronized passwords between the mobile app and your website though. A little frustrating. In store scanner doesn't work well either. Thanks for trying though.,US,2014-12-10 01:32:00,3,Tutancommon,Concerned mama,472014516,
12746,Thank you for adding the ability to paste passwords into your app. I can now confidently give this app 5 stars now.,US,2014-12-09 23:40:00,5,armchairgeek,Thank you,472014516,
12747,I was so excited that kohl's had an app but it is terrible! So many problems and glitches\, especially with the yes2you rewards. Very disappointed and frustrated.,US,2014-12-09 21:58:00,1,xXx alexandria xXx,TERRIBLE APP,472014516,

12749,First time trying to use in store and the wallet feature wouldn't work. 'Server error - try again after some time'. No time to wait as I'm holding up the line! Had to go fishing through my email to find Kohl's cash and Rewards. App is no good if it won't work at checkout. Received same error when trying to place order online a couple times.  The concept of storing all rewards\, cash\, promos etc. is nice\, but I have yet to see it work correctly!,US,2014-12-09 02:49:00,2,I am that mom,Wallet is useless!,472014516,
12750,I love how you can store your Kohls cash and coupons in the app.  The shopping part is pretty good too.  However\, the 'find in store' function does not work.  Nothing shows up at all.  Also\, my shopping list disappeared and I can't even create one now. Also\, you should be able to stay signed in or use TouchID to sign in after setting up.  Otherwise you might not remember your password at the store and not be able to access your 'wallet'.,US,2014-12-08 22:27:00,3,DDDJohnson,Good but some functions don't work,472014516,
12751,I spent about an hour filling my cart with Christmas gifts. Every time I went to check my total\, I had to re-enter my discount code. That was just the first issue. It took me over an hour AFTER I was done shopping to finally complete my order. I had 18 items in my cart and I had to individually select a box to indicate that I needed a gift receipt for each one. Unfortunately\, I had to do this 5+ times because the discount code kept disappearing. Every time I had to re-enter my discount code\, I had to recheck 18 gift receipt boxes. When I finally got to the point of submitting my order\, the App popped up with an error code saying they were having issues and I needed to try again later. It took several more attempts of starting over with the gift receipt clicking and discount code before the app started to work again. Then to make it even more of a pain\, I was being charged 5.95 per item for gift wrapping even though my choices were selected that I DID NOT want wrapping. I only wanted a gift receipt. I went back to edit this and of course it made me start all over. I would've given up much sooner except I already wasted so much time shopping and found items I wanted. I could've shopped in a store and saved a lot of time and frustration. I will not be using this app again for shopping!,US,2014-12-07 21:33:00,2,Cathyannh86,So many issues,472014516,
12752,The app is ok. There is no option to save your username and password. So\, I have to sign in every time I want to use the app.No clear instructions on how to link my reward with kohl's card.,US,2014-12-06 16:00:00,3,Hernkz,You have to sign in every time,472014516,

12754,Bogus app. Nothing works the way they claim. Looks like it's a sneaky way for them to get your contact info so they can hit you with spam.,US,2014-12-05 13:23:00,1,Honda Honey 100,POS,472014516,
12755,The app did scan my Kohls cash for 'the wallet'\, but isn't saving 'the lists'...so after carefully selecting 40 minutes of Christmas gifts\, the App won't retrieve any of them. :/,US,2014-12-03 18:05:00,3,BioDiva99,Not an A List App,472014516,
12756,I read quite a few reviews that listed many problems. I haven't had any major problems. My Kohl's cash\, coupons and rewards are all right there. Simple. The only hiccup I had was the reminders that the app allows you to set to remind you of expiration dates don't work. I tried to set it for 3 days before the expiration date. It went off moments later. I tried again for 3 days and a day before. Both went off moments later. Ehh\, before the app I had to remember the dates anyway and I can always set a simple iPhone reminder  if really necessary. I hope this app ends up working well for everyone soon\, but I'm quite happy with it!,US,2014-12-03 16:15:00,4,Mysundown,Great Idea! Only minor problems here.,472014516,
12757,I like this app to look up items and shop but my recent order I had a difficult time checking out and inputting my Kohls cash. It doesn't save it if you need to review your cart. Also it needs improvements to edit shopping lists. I'm adding too be for Christmas but I can't edit it here I have to use the website for that and to share it. Please fix this!,US,2014-12-03 06:10:00,3,Erin Jando,Needs work!,472014516,

12760,When it comes to the Yes2You rewards this app is not user friendly.  The reward was not in my wallet nor could I get it to load to my wallet.

12763,This is a good app. I have not had issues some are reporting.  It works well and easy to navigate. I buy mostly online and I like kohls a lot and happy to easily buy from them now.,US,2014-11-29 23:58:00,5,Sirius23239bravo,Good app,472014516,
12764,App needs to have a few bugs fixed to be great:(1) Scanner does not work when entering receipt barcodes(2) login does not allow password to be pasted(3) cannot retain login information for an extended period of time(4) ability to link kohls charge and Yes2Rewards cards,US,2014-11-29 21:12:00,2,Pharaohv,Good\, but....,472014516,
12765,There needs to be a way to enter your receipt if you forget to present your Kohl's Rewards card at time of check out. Keep up the good work.,US,2014-11-29 19:50:00,3,Ahoos,Not bad,472014516,

12767,I'm giving this app 5 stars!  It was a day before Thanksgiving and my mom had to use up $40 worth of Kohl's cash. So we went online and tried to order through their early Black Friday items. BUT\, their website was down. We were super bummed that we couldn't order.... Until I found the app!! We were able to purchase what we wanted\, and use our Kohl's cash in time!!! We were so happy! 5 stars ,US,2014-11-28 22:09:00,5,MelJayne99,It worked really well!!,472014516,

12769,Scanned my Kohls cash into my wallet\, signed out and when I came back to the app to use it the Kohls cash was gone and when I scanned the coupon again was told it was invalid and had already been redeemed. Now I can't sign into my account at all. Just keep your paper Kohls cash and your reward card in your wallet. Much easier than using this app.,US,2014-11-28 02:31:00,1,Rita Maske,Needs so much improvement,472014516,
12770,I've never liked this app. Just not user friendly and does not sync with computer. app support takes you to their basic online help page and I just saw it wanted access to my motion activity. Why?  In deleted this. Too invasive.,US,2014-11-27 23:51:00,2,Mimi99999999,Not user friendly,472014516,
12771,This app would be fine and earned a much higher rating from me if not for all the mandatory updates. The things these updates fix are extremely minute and it is much more frustrating to have to constantly wait for an update before I can BROWSE the site than the 'bugs' the updates claim to fix.  Very frustrating. Shop using your web browser\, it's much less of a hassle.,US,2014-11-27 12:30:00,1,Banicula15,Mandatory Updates Are Awful!,472014516,
12772,I downloaded this app on my phone for the soul purpose of paying my Kohl's Charge bill especially since I don't have a computer. What kind of mobile app tells you you need to log in on a non mobile site to pay a bill?? If they don't wanna include this feature\, fine\, but at least remove the button option... Most credit cards with apps allow you to pay with it. But unfortunately not this card. That why I think this app could be better.,US,2014-11-27 10:12:00,2,Amethyst428,Could be better,472014516,
12773,Ever since I used the app for the first time shopping at Kohl's the app went downhill from there. It all worked fine before I was shopping at Kohl's until I used it at checkout.

12789,11/17/14Well\, the user interface has been improved\, but this app is still painfully slow to use. Better options would be 1) just use a mobile browser to access the desktop site\, 2) use a desktop or laptop computer or tablet\, or 3) just drive to the store. Meanwhile\, can't paste your password into the text box to log in?! Are you kidding?!?!?!10/30/14Just reiterating that this is one of the worst apps I've ever used\, and is easily THE worst online shopping type of app I've ever used. Just wait until you are at a desktop or laptop computer and try your luck with the web site and save yourself a ton of frustration (and time). 10/12/14While I still like Kohl's a lot for various shopping needs\, this app is positivity painful to even use. It is one of the most wretched online shopping apps I've ever seen--yes\, even much worse than Home Depot's. ------------------------Why do a number of HUGE companies have trouble developing a decent online shopping app that conforms to at least the minimal standards and basic usability guidelines?,US,2014-11-24 03:50:00,1,Mr. Zyler,Absolutely Marginal Attempt,472014516,
12790,The app was broken in the first place and now the update has made it unresponsive to discount entry. Now i can't scan nor manually enter promo codes.

12795,Kohls all I have to say is use ApplePay.  I will only go to places or use mobile apps that accept that now. Security is the most important thing for customers and Apple Inc. has nailed it.,US,2014-11-21 21:15:00,1,wscow84,Use ApplePay or loose business and end up like Mervyn's,472014516,
12796,Just downloaded and signed in to this app. It won't allow my yes2you info\, scanner doesn't work\, back up of inputting coupons by hand doesn't work. Amazingly the only thing it will let me do is shop online. Not gonna happen.,US,2014-11-21 14:59:00,1,tplumer,Crap app,472014516,
12797,I've called customer service twice and was told the problems I am having are because I use an iOS. That answer is ridiculous. Horrible app.,US,2014-11-21 00:37:00,1,AABlue,HORRIBLE,472014516,
12798,I'm not sure why others seem to be having so much trouble with this app. It works perfect for me\, and I am horrible at online stuff. I scan my Kohl's cash certificate and other coupons into my wallet. It stores them fine. I have no problem pulling them up when I'm checking out. It posts my yes2you rewards accurately. I don't shop online with the app because the pictures are too tiny for me\, I prefer to use my computer. So I can't argue to its jitteriness when shopping. I'll agree that I wish it would keep me logged in longer. But I haven't felt put out by having to log in. And it's never timed me out while I was actively using it.,US,2014-11-20 16:35:00,5,Ana Stovall,Love the convenience,472014516,
12799,there is NO paste field for the password. do you expect me to type in a 20+ character password without the ability to paste one in. and it keep losing my id info! requiring me to log back in over and over.,US,2014-11-20 14:09:00,2,gizmovision,no password paste,472014516,
12800,Userid and password not recognized\, or says can't connect to server. This is while I am in kohls in store wifi too.

12801,Frustrating to use. Doesn't respond.,US,2014-11-19 21:54:00,2,Not2bme,Worse than the old app.  Why??,472014516,
12802,The wallet feature for rewards and kohls cash is awesome to have 'all in one.' However\, you can't enter an item number cuz it won't find it. Your lists disappear. Great idea for Kohls but come on guys\, fix it and make it up to Kohls standard.!.!.! Please evaluate app and fix errors. These and others should be basic functions.!!,US,2014-11-19 20:56:00,2,Trakay69,Needs work,472014516,

12804,This app is STILL AWEFUL and WEBSITE is just as bad. It always says my credit card has invalid characters when it doesn't. If I take out the promo code emailed to me(lots of letters and numbers) then it will work but i don't want to checkout without the discount. What a bunch of dummies to email someone a code for 20%\, 30% or 40% and then they can't use it. I will not shop here for Black Friday deals or anything through christmas!!  Also\, You have to go through till almost end just to see what a special discount code percentage off would be. Aweful aweful aweful. Oh and don't get me started on this new Yes2rewards. I tried to sign up and it won't let me bc it says there are too many phone numbers registered for my acct so it needs my rewards number to tie to my acct BUT I HAVENT EVEN REGISTERED FOR THE YES2REWARDS PROGRAM YET!!!

12811,Worst app ever. Never has the right amount of points on it. When you call the 800 number they act like it's YOUR fault and tell you to keep your receipts and bring them into the store so they can add them to your points. What is the point of having an app if it doesn't work?? Epic fail Kohls!,US,2014-11-18 23:01:00,1,Kelly14u2nv,Mom that shops,472014516,
12812,Never recognizes me username/password. Yet when I go on a normal PC browser with the same exact info it works...,US,2014-11-18 17:52:00,1,Nin884,Horrible,472014516,
12813,After signing up the feature that allows you to scan the Kohls Cash coupon does NOT WORK!!!!! My Rewards will not download. Waste of my time.,US,2014-11-18 11:58:00,1,DeeDee Kardash,,472014516,
12814,I'm really shocked that Kohls\, the marketing genius\, has such a horrible app. When you forget your password it sends you some weird password then you can't copy and paste it on their site. You have to log in many times and nothing ever syncs. I hope Kohls is reading these reviews and totally revamps their app. I can never get into this thing!!!!,US,2014-11-18 02:07:00,1,Raleigh shopper,Frustrating!,472014516,
12815,This is one app I can't do anything! I search for items\, add to cart and then white screen. I use many retailer apps to shop and this one simply doesn't work..many lost sales from me. The charge card portion of the app even worse. Tells me wrong user id and password every time but I use the desktop version and log in perfect. Kohl's also doesn't have classic site when using on mobile..major thumbs down.,US,2014-11-17 00:20:00,1,Hjjjjekfjgeejhe,Doesn't work,472014516,
12816,App needs a lot of work! Bar code scanner doesn't work\, it won't scan clothing in store and it won't scan Kohl's cash into the checkout section. Tried to sign up for rewards and entered allow my info only for it to have the sprite twirling forever on the screen and nothing happen. I have 100mbs download at home so I know it has nothing to do with my internet connection... Get back to the drawing board fellas!,US,2014-11-16 23:45:00,1,richrod,APP Less than adequate,472014516,
12817,I never write reviews! This is my first one ever...Knowing a national retailer accepted this and let it go out to public is pathetic.

Due to the lack of consumer concern I will definitely not be purchasing from Kohls this holiday season!,US,2014-11-16 23:32:00,1,Jimmyb09,Worst app!,472014516,
12818,The wallet NEVER works when you need it to. I will sign in (over and over because it never leaves you signed in for very long) and it will show a zero value for kohls cash\, yes 2 you rewards and kohls offers\, even though I have offers and rewards available.  Usually it says session timed out and then suggests I call an 800 number. Like that will somehow help when the cashier needs something to scan to use my offer and reward. I am very disappointed and won't be wasting my phone's precious memory on such a sad excuse for an app.,US,2014-11-16 20:52:00,1,Erin Denney,Terrible App\, Worst Store App Ever,472014516,
12819,Not one to leave many reviews\, but as a personal app developer myself\, apps like this bother me like no other. It's slow\, it's jittery\, and it makes for a terrible time attempting to shop. Instead of making a mobile website and wrapping it in an app\, why not invest the resources into developing an actually useful\, functioning\, native mobile experience? The app doesn't work how it should. Point in case\, work arounds and short cuts like this (most times) aren't a solution.,US,2014-11-16 04:59:00,1,Jake.W.,Workarounds,472014516,

12822,This is the worst app I've ever used. It constantly wants me to log in. Completely worthless since you can't do anything with app. Not sure why Kohl's is not responding to all the negative reviews and updating their app.,US,2014-11-15 22:32:00,1,TDurden14,Worthless,472014516,

12835,App is hard to use. Doesn't load until I press button multiple times.  I can't get my Reward card to link.  When searching for an item\, I click on item then click out & it takes you back to main screen so you have to input search criteria all over again.  Difficult & frustrating. Love Kohls.

12837,These features are great\, WHEN THEY WORK! I have to fight to login\, having to reset the password multiple times. The less cards I have to carry\, the better. It's super convenient to have my rewards/Kohl's cash on my phone. What's not convenient tho is standing by the registers for 15 minutes trying to login. Needless to say\, I'll be carrying my rewards card and Kohl's cash until this is fixed. Major let down. The scanner is completely useless. You have to manually enter Kohl's cash/coupons. Hopefully this is fixed soon bc I really like this app and Kohl's is my fave store!,US,2014-11-10 17:18:00,1,Manalynn0143,Great app (in theory),472014516,

12839,You will be glad you did. It never works correctly. I cannot log in. I get a message that I am not using the correct password every time. I have changed my password daily and then it doesn't work the next day. Customer service is clueless! They have given me a bad impression of Kohl's. Don't waste your time. I am deleting it now! Love(d) Kohl's. HATE the app.,US,2014-11-10 00:55:00,1,Please fix2,Forget this app!...,472014516,

12841,This app makes me so angry. Every Time I am in the store\, I try to use the app. I can never log in. They tell me to call and I can add my points later. When I call\, I can never get through. I am so irritated! I cannot believe they advertise this app on commercials!,US,2014-11-09 13:35:00,1,LBed,Terrible App!,472014516,
12842,I have to login over and over again. When you click on the wallet tab and login in I see my cards for 2 seconds and it logs me back out. The app is useless because it won't keep you logged in. Please fix!,US,2014-11-09 02:37:00,1,Makle373,Horrible,472014516,
12843,Logging in is a real pain; please enable touch ID\, or at least a pin code to unlock.Get rid of the “how to” video\, the app should be designed so a video isn’t necessary.  The video gets in the way of scrolling.If you really want to make customers happy\, push the available discounts to the app\, instead of forcing people to scan them.Consider integrating with something like Stocard to push discounts.  If you make it easy\, people will buy more. :-)Integrate the Kohl’s rewards program with the Kohl’s credit card.  Finally\, hire a usability specialist\, you really need one.,US,2014-11-08 21:10:00,1,Mrs.DeepBlue,So many improvements need to be made,472014516,

12846,This app is nothing but an ad flyer. It doesn't keep you logged in; it doesn't know you have rewards and should\, since they are earned under the same email; there is no way to get a reward issued by email into your wallet without printing and scanning; it tells me my reward ID is invalid sometimes yet seems valid at other times; and the one time I tried to use it at a Kohl's it would not load at all. Don't bother.,US,2014-11-08 12:26:00,1,Lostinpok,Useless,472014516,

12848,Do you really think I'm going to spend money on products I can't zoom in on? What did you do to the pictures that I can't zoom in them? That literally makes this app WORSE than using your website on my phone. This makes ZERO sense.,US,2014-11-08 01:31:00,1,SplendaJoy,Unacceptable,472014516,

12850,DO NOT LOAD YOUR KOHL'S CASH INTO THIS APP!I earned $10 on Oct. 18\, 2014 where I also learned about this app. I uploaded my Kohl's cash to it and all appeared to be fine. I am now about a week away from it expiring so I check my app. The cash is gone! I called customer support and spoke to a guy from Sri Lanka named 'Dave'. 'Dave' is new to 'English'. He was no help but did refer me back to the store where I 'earned' my cash. Great job Kohl's. Please leave app design to the grown ups. Horrible app.,US,2014-11-06 20:49:00,1,ShutterNutt,Disappearing Kohl's Cash!,472014516,

12853,Nice ideas\, poorly executed. I've had to login more times than I can count and change my password\, that I kept entering correctly\, to bypass the login errors. Now I'm in and logged in. On one tab is stays welcome (my name) saying that I am logged in. On the shopping bag tab it has sign out as an option yet has nothing in the bag and is telling me to sign in to see my shopping bag. I had to scan and manually enter kohls cash and rewards multiple times to the wallet tab and they never showed. Today they are there but I continue to have the shopping bag issues. Also it appears you have to login each one you open it.,US,2014-11-04 14:10:00,1,I hate bills,Terrible,472014516,
12854,The app has numerous glitches. It's always freezing\, when you click on an item to view it the pop-up doesn't open correctly\, the pictures are extremely blurry\, swatches have the wrong colors associated etc   It's not worth the time and aggravation.,US,2014-11-04 04:39:00,1,Mary DePetris,Useless,472014516,

12857,My rewards card is shown when I log in BUT I continue to get a pop-up that says wrong rewards number! I deleted the app a long time ago bc it didn't work then either in regards to shopping cart and payment \,everything. Decided to give it another try and again it failed.

12858,I have an iPhone 3GS and can not install iOS 7.   Why would you create an app that requires the software on the new iPhone?  This ignores customers that have a working iPhone 3GS or older and do not need to update their phones.,US,2014-11-03 17:35:00,1,,Can't download the app,472014516,
12859,Not only is it difficult to navigate\, but this app can't even do what it's meant to do! I can't check out because of a weird issue at the address screen (and even their mobile site wouldn't let me check out -- it has its own bugs)\, it keeps telling me 'invalid rewards number\, please re-enter' even though it shows my number and correctly links to that account\, and it's horribly slow. Don't bother. Scan your card at the kiosk and use the desktop (not app OR mobile site) if you want to purchase something.,US,2014-11-03 17:07:00,1,Friend Called 5,Spectacularly terrible,472014516,

12863,Not only do I have to sign in what feels like a thousand times in this app\, it also doesn't 'talk' to any other shopping carts you might have created on another device. So even if I am signed into my kohls account on my computer AND in my app \, my kohls account doesn't update. And this 'great' wallet in the app never works. I've went back to my emails and loaded my kohls cash and yes to you rewards cash and they transfer over onto the app\, but the next time I sign In they are gone! Grrrr! What's the point of having this wallet when it never works! Someone needs to get their act together with this app and fix the bugs-absolutely horrible app!,US,2014-11-03 13:10:00,1,No go do not get,Horrible app and waste of time,472014516,
12864,This app has great potential. It has a lot of great features but none of them work. Log in is hit or miss. It will even tell me my log in failed when it didn't. Yes 2 You and Kohl's Cash always read 0 even though I've linked my accts and should have credit. I've allowed the cashier I scan the Y2Y barcode on my phone so now I don't even know if I'll get the credit I should. I try to add  Kohl's Cash but the barcode scanner doesn't read it. Manually enter and the balance never updates. Try to add again a few days later and it says it's already been added but the balance still reads 0. Basically\, this app has a lot of features that don't work. It's a useless cluster at the moment. I'd love to see it fixed.,US,2014-11-03 12:41:00,1,RDHjeannie,Needs a lot of work,472014516,
12865,The app is as useless as their mobile website and the online store. Online customer service is pretty crappy as well.,US,2014-11-03 04:56:00,1,noellemt,Awful,472014516,
12866,I'm not sure why I still have this app on my phone. I only got the app to keep track of my Yes2You rewards and coupons. However\, it rarely is updated. It takes days for the app to add my rewards and Kohls Cash even after I manually enter the barcode and pin into the app!Also\, how annoying is it to login every time you open the app?! It never saves my account info\, I have to log-in again and again. Super annoying while in the store and trying to pull up my coupons and rewards to scan at the check out.,US,2014-11-03 00:45:00,1,Gold Frapps,Completely Unreliable,472014516,
12867,After signing in\, clicking 'yes2you' rewards signs me back out immediately.  I signed in at least 10 times\, then gave up.  Works fine from Safari.  App is broken.,US,2014-11-02 21:22:00,1,MetaChimp,Yes2You does not work,472014516,
12868,Useless. What's the point in letting me load all my coupons ( and then throw them out believing I wouldn't need them!) and then when it's time to check out\, oh look at that\, I can't use any of the coupons in my 'wallet'. Not happy\, Kohl's!!!,US,2014-11-02 19:42:00,1,KohlsLover,Very Disappointing!!,472014516,
12869,This app sounded like a great idea but is absolutely worthless. Kohls needs to get their developers to fix this ASAP. Can't say I would trust it to hold all my data if it ever gets fixed. Considering I can't login (just attempt to donut and am prompted to do it again)\, I would hate to lose Kohls cash codes or reward codes because of an app. Really wish I could give this zero stars since it has zero value. I will just access the Kohls website via my phone instead.,US,2014-11-02 16:37:00,1,Calikrissy,Worthless App,472014516,
12870,Thank you to the other reviewers who have reported the same problem. I have changed my password\, deleted and reinstalled the app. It still won't let me log on.

12872,It's a shame a retailer as big as Kohl's can't pay a company to design a functioning app.  Borderline crap would be a complement.

12873,You can't login using this app or even going directly to my kohls charge through the browser on my phone\, even using correct username and password! The only way to login to my kohls charge is through my laptop.  Makes no sense\, my mobile device is just as much of a computer as my laptop is! Wish I could give this negative 5 stars.,US,2014-11-01 18:17:00,1,IfIdidmyjobthishalf-assed,Can't log in with correct user and password,472014516,

12875,I love Kohls.  But at the very least you could do is have this app remember my login!! That is very basic in an app.  It's ridiculous that I have to put that in every time.  You could also get fancy and just know if I use my rewards card and I earn cash to automatically put it in to my account on the app.,US,2014-11-01 13:59:00,1,Credente,Obviously they do not read reviews,472014516,
12876,Nothing like being excited to download a new app for shopping and seeing it only has one star ⭐️. I suggest you fix this app and make some of your current customers happy before I'll even take a chance on it. Thanks for the great constructive reviews. Sure hope Kohls takes the time to listen.,US,2014-11-01 08:02:00,1,Frank214214214,Won't download until there are some good reviews.,472014516,

12882,Horrible\, terrible experience.  I spent 20 minutes entering and re-entering my information\, deleted and reloaded the app twice. It still doesn't work.  I had read the one star reviews and was hopeful that it was just a glitch with the user.  It isn't.  It's the app itself. Super frustrating!!,US,2014-10-28 22:51:00,1,Happydaizee,No good.,472014516,

12884,Please fix so that you don't have to log in every time you open the 'wallet' section.

12891,I am able to add all my coupon codes and yes2you rewards quite easily - one complaint is that it does not link to the Kohl's charge and signs me out every day.

12892,OMG! They gave me credit. Went to the store\, huge line. No thanks. I registered my new acct online and tried to shop. NOPE! I even was registered with my name on  the web page I couldn't shop. Put in my email - sorry no record of it. Typed in my acct #. Sorry no record of ur number. Called in. Sorry we're closed.

12895,I grabbed this app ready to shop and I ended up leaving with nothing. Preview images are terrible so you have to load each product individually to get a good quality view. Then there's no sizing info on the clothes once you're in there. It instills no faith in what you might buy so you know you're going to get stuck returning to the store. No thanks.,US,2014-10-26 20:39:00,1,Dave Sentenn,It's a shame,472014516,
12896,I tried using this app last week and placed an order. It told me my card information was  incorrect. I verified my card information was right and tried again from a web browser on my PC. Same error. Tried four more times from various browsers and PCs. Same result\, only I had to RE-ENTER all of my coupon codes and Kohl's cash codes every single time!!!Checked my credit card site and found one pending Kohl's charge for the order amount and five declined because it was duplicate orders. Thankfully my credit card recognized it as such or I would've had six charges go through. But wait\, my order did NOT go though\, the pending charge disappeared two days later\, so I called and placed the order by PHONE. STILL DIDNT GO THROUGH! Now my Kohl's cash expired\, my coupon expired\, and the jackets I'm trying to buy for my children are no longer 50% off! Went to the store and explained what happened and asked them to honor the prices\, even showed screenshots of what happened. They would NOT!!!Fast forward to this weekend. I tried logging on to my Kohl's app to check my account and it won't log in\, just keeps bringing the login screen back up!This app is horrible\, your website is horrible\, your phone ordering is horrible\, and your customer service is NONEXISTENT! Your only saving grace is your store\, which is a sad statement because it never has the sizes I need for my kids\, all of whom wear regular sizes so it's not a tall order to ask for. It's absurd that I can't use the 'cash' I earned because of a glitch in YOUR SYSTEM but you won't honor them when I return to tell you what happened. I started shopping at Kohl's last year and have decided that it's just not worth the hassle. Any cost savings are lost to your lack of customer satisfaction or customer service. Your glitchy technology and marketplace ignorance has resulted in customer turnover of record-breaking proportions\, and that is NOT a metric you should increase if you want to stay competitive.,US,2014-10-26 19:02:00,1,SPHR Executive,Horrible App\, Terrible Website\, and Awful Customer Service!,472014516,

12900,Does not work!!!  I wish I had the read these reviews before wasting my time trying to get this app to work.  It signs me out\, immediately after I have signed in.  I have reset my password more times than I care to count\, thinking this was a user error not an app malfunction.   I have yet to be able to sign in and get a coupon or Kohl’s cash loaded.  This app needs some major improvement.,US,2014-10-25 20:31:00,1,Mojo8090,Wish I hadn’t wasted my time,472014516,
12901,Ever since you've changed over to this new app I haven't been able to pay bill with my phone. I fill everything out\, push the submit button and nothing happens. For the past few months I have been charged late fees because my payment wasn't going through. I've had to call and wait for a representative and pay that way\, which is very inconvenient when I used to be able to do it online.

12925,I agree with everyone\, this app is useless. The features that they advertise are inaccessible\, I have tried several times to log on my account\, it just plain doesn't\, it does not give me a reason why it is not logging on. I was looking forward to check out the new features of this upgrade but now I'm very frustrated because i cannot use them. Please fix these issues so that we can use the app as you intended. Also I wrote I complaint to there costumer service and never received a reply. Hopefully this gets them going on to fix this issue.

12931,Hate to say it\, but this app is horrible. Won't accept mylogin credentials (even after resetting my password). It resets your search criteria while shopping and doesn't allow more than one filter in certain departments (i.e. Jewelery - searching necklaces AND bracelets). When you filter price range $50-$100 is actually only shows you items that were ORIGINALLY $100. The  updates are also super annoying. Everyone loves an improved app - but please stop making it MANDATORY to update it before being able to use it (unless\, of course\, the update has solved all of it's problems!!). Seems like it happens every time I want to use it\, which takes all the convenience out of it. I've found it easier to just shop using the Kohls website.,US,2014-10-16 15:32:00,1,blondecurve,Pretty bad. Fix this App!,472014516,

12933,This app is great for lots if things. For example\, you can see your shopping bag!  You can't do anything with it\, but it's heartwarming to know it's there. Also\, watching the little circular arrow going around and around and around ... Well\, it's just good clean fun. Almost fun enough to forget that I wanted to 'search' for an item.

12939,Don't download. Got the app so I could keep my Kohls Cash and coupons in one place instead of managing lots of paper. I have yet to be able to enter any coupons I have received. Each comes up either as invalid or there is no way to enter. Good luck trying to enter your 30% coupon or even the 15% thanks for joining coupon. Have had the same poor experience entering the cash. Won't happen. It only seems to be a vehicle for driving additional sales\, not making the customer experience remotely satisfactory. Just keep carrying your coupons\, it's less frustrating.,US,2014-10-14 23:56:00,1,BlackSquirrelKSU4,Borderline worthless,472014516,
12940,Please\, read this and update the app to be better than it is now. It is unusable. I shop online a lot and Kohl's is definitely one of the worst when it comes to apps and such. A major problem is that I can login and have three different shopping bags: one on the app\, one on a desktop\, and one on Safari. I am logged into the same exact name. My shopping cart times out very quickly on the desktop. I have to sign in multiple times during one online shopping session. Recently\, I used the app to order. The app kept telling me to try again\, so I did. I even closed out the app and tried again. Apparently\, my order went through 4 times! My card was charged $1000 dollars. Upon contacting them within an hour to cancel\, someone foreign told me to return everything to the store via email. I called first thing in the morning; still told to take it back. Talked online\, told they couldn't cancel.  They could schedule a UPS pick-up\, but I had to pay return shipping. I lost out on Kohl's cash because it took the app so long to work (they did not care) and I get to take over 700 dollars worth of merchandise back to the store. Oh\, and the items are still in my cart 10 days later on the app. I've already received 4 of everything I ordered. Now I get to haul it to Kohl's and apologize profusely to the cashier.,US,2014-10-14 16:05:00,1,WDGill,Horrible app!,472014516,
12941,Hey\, Kohl's: Since you seem to want me to spend so much money in your stores—and you spend incredible resources to get me to do so—you might want to consider fixing your app so that I CAN ACTUALLY LOG IN!!! My password works just fine on the Kohl's website\, but I am not able to log into my account using the Kohl's app. I don't even get an error message\, it just stops trying to log me in and doesn't give any reason.

12945,The only reason i downloaded this app was to avoid keeping kohls cash and scan it in the app. But as soon as you go to wallet\, it signs you out. Long story short- there is no way you can scan your kohls cash,US,2014-10-13 21:14:00,1,Sudigma,No kohls cash scan,472014516,

12950,The app needs more subcategories\, for instance when u choose clearance\, there is no way to look thru any specific category\, u have to look at every single clearance item\, men's\, women's\, boys\, girls\, home\, etc... 24 at a time before it refreshes the list. This takes forever!! Also\, trying to edit your shopping bag is very hard and time consuming! The buttons u push don't show any sign of being pushed what so ever\, and there is a major delay in reaction. Then every time u edit or go back in any way it brings u back to the very top of your shopping bag or search list. I wish this app were more interactive and easy! Also when I was trying to check out\, it wouldn't accept my promo code\, then when it finally did accept\, it said it didn't have my credit card\, which is a kohls charge that has been in the system the whole time I've had the app!!! Needs work!!!!,US,2014-10-12 15:55:00,2,MrsStephens,Pretty annoying,472014516,

12952,I have tried several times just to sign in. It says that my email & password don't match up. I tried to register for a new acct. & it said that my email was already taken. Yeh\, by me!!!! There were times that I was ready to check out & I went to my cart\, put in my promo code & continued to the checkout\, & it said I had aqqad to sign in again. So I tried to\, but it said my info. didn't match again. I spent hours picking out exactly what I wanted & the website said my info. was wrong! It wouldn't let me into my own acct. again. I tried everything & after all that\, my cart went back to 'empty!' Kohl's lost my business for those times I couldn't get thru & if it happens again\, it will be the last time.Thank you\,Sandra E Ozel,US,2014-10-12 11:42:00,1,sandra's music,Sandra E Ozel,472014516,

12956,It continually logs a user out. When stadium in a long line trying to get cashed out that's a pain as you frantically try to log back in to get to coupons. Coupons that get emailed to me are different from the ones in my wallet. So I have to toggle back and forth from the app to email to find the most fitting coupon. And relog in of course. You can't view your kohls card data without exiting the app and going to safari. Then when you go back to the app guess what? You have to relog in!,US,2014-10-11 09:42:00,1,Croth79,Needs lots of work,472014516,

12979,I'm ashamed to say I work for this store because I tell people all the time about the app. I emailed the company because I don't think they pay attention to the reviews. Everyone else should do the same.,US,2014-10-04 18:12:00,1,Stupid username never works!,Terrible!,472014516,
12980,I never had a problem with my kohls  app before now since I got this new card I Cannot even get into anything. When I put my user name and password in is always saying invalid. There is a bug in this app. I even called customer service and they do not even know what they r doing. I was doing a lot of shopping online but no longer unless u just come back with the old kohls app. Even can not use that one. I do not trust this at all. I am even calling for a new card number because in today's day and age with all these new update app u never know who has what of your private information. I even unscribed from this app. Thanks Kohls u will be losing a good customer with this mistake.

13000,Great coupons\, keeps track of your Kohl's cash\, pull everything up and they just scan it at the register. I haven't done the online shopping thing\, but think it's a great tool for in-store use. If it would just remember me so I didn't have to sign in every time it would be a 5 star app.,US,2014-09-30 04:42:00,4,CuteCitCat,Great app for use in store,472014516,

13002,I tried to shop by Category - regardless of what category I choose\, the text just turns gray and nothing loads. What is the point of this app if you can't shop? Who did the QA and UAT for this app? Who approved it for consumer use? With all of the complaints and bugs\, it makes no sense that it's still available in its current state. How can this be positive for sales? Kohl's needs to invest more in its mobile app.,US,2014-09-28 08:29:00,1,reviewer85,Ridiculous,472014516,

13004,After Reading some of the previous reviews I was a little sceptical. But the app works good so far. Had no problem putting items is the bag although I have not purchased yet. The battery life seems to be ok although right now it is draining a little faster as I am writing this review. I turned automatic app refresh off\, maybe that will help. Love that I don't have to open my emails to search for the %off coupon. It is all in one place now together with the reward points.What needs improvement is the expiration date of the coupon/reward cash.

13009,This is the worst shopping app I have ever used. I can't believe a giant store like Kohl's would release this app to the public. It's SLOW\, and the shopping cart doesn't work. I added several items to my cart last night from the regular website\, but they do not show up in the mobile app. I know the items are still in my cart because they still show up on the regular website.

13020,This app has never worked well and is not user friendly. Needs major improvement! I personally think Kohl's needs to take a look at other apps that actually work! For example\, Amazon. You can easily search and put items in your cart and then from there\, 'save for later' while still being able to see & purchase other items. The Amazon app is so easy to use\, I constantly purchase items from there. Also\, I do a lot of shopping with Kohl's\, but never through the app. I either use the computer or sometimes just go to the store. But as an online shopper\, not happy with this app.,US,2014-09-17 18:29:00,1,Billyanalogies,Needs major improvements!,472014516,
13021,This App needs to be started over from scratch!! This lagging dragging nightmare has caused Duplicate Orders\, then the circling arrow seems to get lost and never end!!

13022,I had battery 'problems' for weeks. Never thought this app was the cause\, but it was. It reduced my battery life by about 8 hours per day--just being installed.

13023,This app crashes a lot. It stops loading images and then proceeds to show you a blank screen. Items disappear from cart and using discount codes and kohls cash is difficult. Doesn't sort things well and is overall useless.  I'll stick to using my computer or just drive to the store.,US,2014-09-13 21:44:00,1,Dipsetinthebuilding,Awful,472014516,

13028,Overall\, the app is great for window shopping\, but if you actually want to purchase anything it's a waste of time.

13031,I always try things out for myself and I never really pay attention to reviews but this time I was dumb not to. I didn't even have the app on my phone 10 minutes before I deleted it. I live in Tampa\, am hot metropolitan area\, and it still would not recognize my zip code. Come on. It was also annoying to have to sign in every time I switched from the app to my texts. What's the point if having it on my phone if it's less convenient then surfing the desktop site?

13035,Needs a lot of improvement! I wish I could select coupons and add them to my wallet instead of having to go through them in the latest deals section. Or that it would at least just show you all the coupons available in your wallet and you just scan the ones you need. Also if you could have a section for your kohl's charge account instead of having to open it up in the web browser. It is really slow and whenever I browse through items then go to add them to my cart\, it doesn't go back to the section to where I was last browsing. AND IT TAKES FOREVER TO GET SIGNED IN FOR ME! Every time I have re put my email and password only for it to just load for 10 mins!!,US,2014-08-25 08:28:00,1,juri12345,Needs a lot of improvement,472014516,

13037,App is not at all intuitive nor user friendly.  App logs you out after every time you use it.  When you try to login at the store it takes too long using the slow Kohl’s wireless service\, and then if you get logged in you have to find the bar code in the APP to scan your card.  Store registers can’t read the barcode to scan the APP.  For the coupons\, on some coupons you can only see about a half inch of them which it makes it very hard to see the coupon requirements.The Kohl’s savings program wasn’t thought out well.  In the mail they only give you one card\, and no cards for your key chain.  Really bad planning.,US,2014-08-20 23:46:00,2,RandyandJana,Very disappointing,472014516,
13038,Not the least bit user friendly!

13043,Your images both in the app and on the Website are impossible to decipher any detail other than basic style and a hint of color. You also cannot zoom on an item (not that it would help with such poor quality photos anyway) to see fabric and garment details\, shoe characteristics\, etc.The app is also very sensitive if you hit the wrong area and accidentally close a window you have to start at the beginning and scroll all the way back through.The Website really needs help too via phone. If you click on an item to view it and then go back to your list or search results it sends you automatically back to the top and you have go scroll all the way back to where you were looking.,US,2014-08-15 11:08:00,1,SaraNichol,Poor image quality & NOT user friendly,472014516,

13045,Shopping bag needs work to be able to purchase now or later.  I keep running into the problem that I have many items in my shopping bag and want to checkout but can't purchase all items now and not sure on some items...so I do nothing.   From the item in the shopping bag we desperately need the ability to save for later.  You have a    List feature but you can't move an item to your List from the shopping bag.  Also you can't see the items in your List when in your shopping bag. A better option is....Amazon has the ideal shopping bag where from within the cart you can instantly move an item to Purchase Later or Purchase Now. All items are visible from within the cart so you don't have to go elsewhere to look at a List (out of site out of mind.). Please fix soon because it is holding up purchases I do want to make.

13052,Kohls ... You guys are a major brand company in my opinion and you need to be better than this. I will say this app isn't the worst app in human existence like others might lead to believe but it really is substandard in so many ways. Couldn't find the same items I found on the website and it would not let me use my mail coupon or even finish my purchase. So I ended up going to the local store which is fine because I got the item for nearly half off which is a gyp in it's self because you aren't honest about online prices vs.\, store prices .. Not cool guys. Anyhow it's just incredibly buggy and until it gets some major\, major fixes I'd not bother.,US,2014-08-05 06:06:00,1,SCarrillo85,Deserves less than 1 star,472014516,

13059,The app works fine but works too well. Every time I drive by a Kohl's I get bombarded with the alert 'Welcome to Kohl's' which doesn't stop until I open the app. I've had to put my phone on airplane mode just to get it to stop.,US,2014-07-25 18:50:00,1,Chel_80,Annoying,472014516,

13066,Every time I try to open the application I usually have to try two or three times before it is successful.  Even when the application is open trying to switch to it will cause it to randomly shut down.,US,2014-07-20 17:15:00,1,Norm dePlume,App stability very poor,472014516,
13067,Pretty decent mobile experience\, just a few glaring 'web app wrapped in a native container' issues. The app is useful when I'm looking for products or want to see if anything is new. It does however fail pretty hard on the experience. Please use something like 'Fastclick' to avoid the 300ms delay when tapping on items. The design is basically stock jQuery Mobile\, so I'm a little disappointed by that only because I have to see it every day (mobile developer). Functionality is there\, experience needs some work.,US,2014-07-20 14:50:00,4,Kikketer,Reasonably good jQuery Mobile app,472014516,
13068,This is a terrible App\, you can't add any products to cart without logging in. It's difficult to navigate compared to other retailer Apps.  Needs improvement.,US,2014-07-20 12:37:00,1,Ed_Monkey,Don't Waste your time,472014516,

13070,The basic premise of the app is good but having to sign in each time gets monotonous. Also\, if you open the app to get to a coupon at the register and there is an update available\, you HAVE to update before you can get to the coupon. This is super annoying and embarrassing to hold everyone up.,US,2014-07-19 06:25:00,3,Irishtimbit,Good but updates are annoying.,472014516,
13071,First off\, it crashes constantly. Second\, it wants to turn on Bluetooth\, why? Third\, there is no remember this information button\, so to view my wallet I have to log in every time. Fourth\, passbook support\, duh.,US,2014-07-18 03:55:00,1,Jburns7654,This App is Terrible,472014516,

13076,I love the idea of this app. No more leaving Kohls Cash or coupons at home... Sadly this app falls short by constantly asking me to turn on Bluetooth. If this isn't fixed soon I'll have to uninstall. Also\, if you can't leave me logged in at least have it remember the user name.,US,2014-07-13 17:06:00,1,KiwiMomOfTwo,Please fix Bluetooth popup,472014516,

13078,Used to use the app for shopping but after a May update\, app constantly wants\, no DEMANDS\, that I enable Bluetooth for better location support. Not sure how Bluetooth\, a standard for a small area network\, helps GPS and wifi with location support. Hopefully app will be fixed soon.  Latest update did not fix the issue and tired of annoying Bluetooth pop ups even when app is not open!!

13081,I got the app because I couldn't look at any of the products on the website.. Turns out I can't look at them on the app either!! If you want people to be able to make purchases on your website or app you should probably let people look at them!  would have given a 0 star but that's impossible!!!,US,2014-07-08 03:54:00,1,Tarschicsh,Can't even shop!! ,472014516,

13083,I didn't get a chance to use this app. I got sick of the repeated popup wanting me to turn Bluetooth on. Why? I'm not using a Bluetooth device with the app and I wasn't near a Kohl's store at the time.I deleted the app after at least a dozen popups in 48 hours. The few dollars I would save on the rare occasions that I shop at Kohl's were not worth the aggravation.,US,2014-07-05 04:09:00,1,Mrsenglund07,Too annoying,472014516,
13084,This is the worst app design I've ever experienced. It is always so slow\, unresponsive\, and has the worst interface I've ever seen. There is no easy navigation and it feels so outdated that it makes me not want to shop on their app. I always get frustrated and give up before purchasing anything. This app needs a complete redesign!,US,2014-07-02 05:17:00,1,atwining,Love Kohls\, Hate the App,472014516,
13085,Why make me log in every time?  It doesn't even remember my username - it makes me enter it every time. I always say when I shop at Kohl's\, 'You always have to wait in line at Kohl's.' So now I'm afraid we'll all be waiting even longer while people login to the Kohls apps on their smart phones. Please revise the app to 'Remember' users rather than having them log in at each use.,US,2014-07-01 20:43:00,2,HS5,Nice but needs a quick fix,472014516,

13087,I keep my Bluetooth turned off to save battery and because I have no Bluetooth devices.The app constantly insists that I turn on Bluetooth to allow 'Kohl's' to connect to my Accessories. These popups interrupt any other app I'm using.I found no value from the app\, and would have normally left the app installed\, but because of the popups I removed it.,US,2014-07-01 14:34:00,1,Thom Willecke,Bluetooth,472014516,
13088,The fact this app requires ios7 is stupid. You lose a good period of your customer base that can no longer use your app. Seems dumb for a business to do that.,US,2014-06-28 14:11:00,1,Zackucf,Stupid requirements,472014516,
13089,I appreciate the attempt to improve the app\, but I can no longer use it.  My iPod Touch says that it's completely up to date with iOS 6.1.6\, but Kohls won't let me on without iOS 7?  My iPod gives me notifications when updates are available\, but until they do\, I can't use your app at all.,US,2014-06-28 13:56:00,1,Bullshtein01,iOS 7 Required?,472014516,

13093,It is frustrating having to completely sign in every time you open the app\, and over half the time\, it froze up during the login process. It is constantly using my locator even if I'm not currently using the app\, which is sucking my battery life. I deleted the app\, it wasn't worth the effort.,US,2014-06-25 11:51:00,1,Mrs mbj,Needs work,472014516,

13096,The app is fantastic with the exception of the terribly annoying constant Bluetooth requests that pop-up.  It's Kohl's doesn't remove this request from the app then the whole thing is getting canned. I can't handle that kind of annoyance.,US,2014-06-22 18:37:00,1,amblerhome1869,Scrap the bluetooth requests or get axed,472014516,
13097,Opened the app to add my kohls cash\, the scanner just kept scanning the barcode and wouldn't recognize the barcode unless it was in the 'scan multiple barcodes' screen which then wouldn't work when I clicked 'done\,' so I had to keep canceling it. Then I wanted to add my charge card to the account so I went to the website to make an account and the website claims they can't verify my 12-digit card number that I entered 4 times and I am 100% certain is correct and still works since I just used the card two days ago. I couldn't say all of this in the survey because the survey popped up as soon as I opened the app- before I had any chance to actually try and use it.,US,2014-06-22 16:09:00,1,AntonEgo,Couldn't accomplish anything,472014516,
13098,As others have stated it doesn't accept your username or password regardless if it's accurate. It has to do with the fact that the application is not coded correctly. At this point it's essentially a worthless app\, doesn't mean there is no potential though.,US,2014-06-21 00:22:00,1,HighFlyingSuns,Doesn't work,472014516,

13101,I'm deleting this app. As other customers indicated\, the frequent pop-ups to enable Bluetooth is both annoying and ridiculous.

13127,I ended up having to delete this app. I grew tired of the constant pop up messages telling me to turn on blue tooth. I seldom use blue tooth (to save battery). I couldn't use other apps in my phone due to the constant pop up messages from Kohls. This was really difficult when driving. Once\, I couldn't make a phone call because I had to clear the Kohls app's box first. If I was using my phone\, these pop ups were happening about every 5-10 minutes. I even tried going to my phone's settings and turned off everything for the app. The pop ups still continued.

13148,I was looking forward to downloading the app after hearing the notice about it in a Kohls store. Never be without your coupons!  But instead of loading your coupons in your wallet like other retailers do\, this app let's you take a photo of the coupon you got in the mail. Gee\, thanks. They make you log into your account to access the wallet but they couldn't load the coupon for you?!?!  This will no more ensure that I remember my coupon than the old way of putting it in my purse.

13152,***Kohl's  really is one of the absolute best stores out there! Perfect that they pretty much sell almost everything. Love that they have that Kohl's Rewards % off & cash back!

Yes I'd have to admit that Kohl's is my favorite shopping store! :) ***,US,2014-05-11 02:11:00,5,The comedy channel,AWESOME STORE,472014516,
13153,Found this app after it had info about it on Kohl's cash. I downloaded the app and put in my email (that I use for Kohl's reward card). I scanned the Kohl's cash into the wallet and it showed up along with another coupon that was available. Cashier just scanned them both as I checked out. Super easy to use and I don't have to keep the Kohl's cash anymore. Can just scan them in as soon as I get it. Set up a reminder too so I won't forget to use it. Printed my Kohl's reward and scanned that it too.

13165,The kohls app and i always had a love hate relationship\, i love love love shopping at kohls so i tolerated the app. I understand that Kohls never had the best shopping app\, but now I can't even shop at all. To make the new app version only available to consumers with IOS 7 was pretty lousy. I did not upgrade this year to a new apple product as I'm sure many kohls shoppers did not\, making finger shopping less than enjoyable for myself and other customers. Very disappointed in the way kohls handled this. Please make the app available to all who use the App Store and Love kohls\, not just the Apple upgraders!,US,2014-04-25 21:38:00,1,Jennifer3304,IOS 7???? Really?,472014516,

13173,Turns out that if I had read the reviews I would have seen that the app doesn't actually let you save Kohl's Cash. I downloaded the app because my receipt mentioned I could store my kohl's cash there and that sounded wonderful. Unfortunately this function is maddening on the app. In 'My Wallet' there are two different barcode icons. Neither works. And they fail in different ways. The 'single' icon won't scan at all. And although the 'double' icon does scan\, it will not save it. And when you leave it warns you that you are deleting the scanned kohl's cash\, but it won't save it.  I love kohl's\, but this app is erasing all the good thoughts I have for them.,US,2014-04-13 21:38:00,1,Jim Reilly,Installed Despite the Low Rating & Shouldn't Have,472014516,

13176,When I unlocked my phone I noticed the gps icon in the corner. I went into the privacy settings and the Kohl's app was using the GPS. I hadn't ran the app in a week and it wasn't even in the app list when I double tapped the home key. I disabled the gps function for kohls but I shouldn't have to jump thru these hoops.,US,2014-04-10 12:54:00,2,Shawn Hendricks,Battery burner,472014516,
13177,This is an ok app if you just want to see what the price is online\, but now you can do that in the store!

13178,I can't use the app I currently have installed on my phone until I update it. And I can't update the app until I update my phone to iOS 7.

13180,Location services is always on with this app\, even when it's closed!!!!! This app is OK to use to browse\, but prices don't load properly (sales prices will show while shopping\, but won't load properly in checkout)\, cash and coupon codes don't save if you go back a page\, making you enter them all over again\, and it doesn't scroll back to where you left off in an item list if you view an item then go back.

13282,The app has improved slightly over time\, but is still full of glitches. One big issue is that\, even when I'm signed into my account\, I can't put things in my cart and have them show up there when I go online from my desktop. Another is that it always tells me I have no current orders\, whether I place the order through the app or via my laptop browser. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that I can't access the full site through safari. Even when I click 'full site' multiple times\, it always revert to the mobile site. So\, there is no way to track orders from my phone - neither the app nor the mobile site through safari will provide that information. Since kohl's has\, apparently\, gotten bad about sending shipping emails\, that is a real problem. I love Kohls's\, but they desperately need to upgrade the online shopping experience.,US,2013-12-06 17:33:00,1,DD58,Too many glitches,472014516,

13284,mobile online site works better.  this one crashes and does even more annoying things\, such as tells you sku # 0 in your bag no longer exists\, yet it won't let you delete the item so that you can proceed. I had to uninstall then reinstall the app to bypass. THEN it allows you to store your Kohl's cash in the app which is neat\, but when you go to checkout it won't let you transfer the cash you've saved IN THE APP to the checkout--- it makes you re-enter the barcodes and PINs of all your cash again. and if that wasn't annoying enough\, it will let you add a coupon code\, but won't show your discount unless you proceed to the confirm order screen\, then you have to back out to shop more. THEN if you finally get a coupon code to register but then go shop more\, when you check- out it doesn't save your code- you have to enter it AGAIN. did I mention it accepted an order\, then I couldn't find the order in the app to check status the next day\, and a day later I got an email saying the system had cancelled my order?? it's a complete PITA. I gave up ordering tonight and just quit. fix all of these bugs\, Kohl's\, and you might have a halfway decent app.I also suspect that the glowing reviews are fake\, because there's no way these people are using the same app I am.,US,2013-12-05 03:23:00,2,vader0708,full of bugs!!,472014516,

If your store wasn't convenient for my elderly patents I would say forget it !David Small Smalzmail@aol. Com,US,2013-11-22 08:41:00,1,David SmalZ,Your site is aweful!,472014516,
13302,Please add the ability to remain signed in. It always logs me out once I exit the app and have to log in again to use the wallet.,US,2013-11-21 18:23:00,3,Mekus,Sign-in,472014516,
13303,How did I not know about this app sooner? Love this! Can't wait to use this for my Xmas shopping! Thanks Kohls!!,US,2013-11-19 02:30:00,5,Notsoshybrunette,Awesome! Thank you Kohls!!,472014516,
13304,Basically it crashes every time I click any button on the ap,US,2013-11-18 21:59:00,1,Sweetsonia,Errors for everything,472014516,
13305,I'm not that computer savvy and I could easily navigate and shop.  Well done!,US,2013-11-18 16:23:00,5,Randall46,Great App,472014516,
13306,Love this app! So fast\, convenient and user friendly!,US,2013-11-18 13:09:00,5,Amandapackel,Kohls app,472014516,
13307,Terrible app. Won't let me add anything to cart. When you hit back button it takes you ALL the way back to category page instead of the items I was browsing.,US,2013-11-17 19:17:00,1,90210313,Won't let me add to cart,472014516,
13308,My wife is always complaining she forgot her Kohl's Cash or her coupon. Great add-on that lets her save it in the app itself. It finally is fast\, too!,US,2013-11-17 18:53:00,5,Kipku,Finally!,472014516,
13309,So impressed with the new Wallet option! Kohls you did this right!!!! I have misplaced\, forgotten and lost (in my purse) Kohls cash more times than I can remember. I do know that I always know where my phone is though\, and that's with me! The option to put my Kohls cash in my app is amazing...best feature ever! Now I will actually use it and not be looking frantically for it :) Way to go Kohls,US,2013-11-17 18:23:00,5,Jennamoha,Wallet Option is AMAZING!!,472014516,
13310,As soon as u agree to the terms,US,2013-11-17 15:07:00,1,Hananke,Just crashes,472014516,
13311,Kohls app has not worked correctly since the big update on the iPhone  - totally not worth your time I added 1 item to my cart and then the app crashed,US,2013-11-17 04:02:00,1,Awesome football,Terrible App,472014516,
13312,I love the barcode scanner. I used it today trying to locate an item in a different size. Worked great.,US,2013-11-16 23:41:00,5,Kimtman,Great app.,472014516,
13313,Keeps crashing,US,2013-11-16 14:34:00,1,Rainy!!!!!!!!(:,Can't even use it,472014516,
13314,My app keeps on crashing!!:(,US,2013-11-16 10:04:00,1,Cookie<3!!!!,Crashes,472014516,
13315,It started causing my phone to heat up!!I had to go into settings\, privacy & disable location in kohls app :(Plz fix!,US,2013-11-15 04:36:00,1,Adrian79,Location service bug,472014516,
13316,Crashes on opening...,US,2013-11-13 04:23:00,1,Luis Haro,Can't open,472014516,
13317,You need to find a way to have the back button NOT take you to the beginning of a search. Each time you hit the button\, you start the search all over again. Really a pain and lame for the modern era.,US,2013-11-12 01:26:00,2,Sbll,Navigating stinks,472014516,
13318,Will not let me add Kohl's Cash.  Doesn't stay logged in and have to log in every time I open.,US,2013-11-10 23:14:00,2,MB927,Disappointed,472014516,
13319,This app claims to be able to scan bar codes\, but no matter what I tried scanning (and I tried many codes multiple times) the same sad error message appeared - no item found. So\, worthless!,US,2013-11-10 21:36:00,1,David-n-NC,Worthless,472014516,
13320,Cannot open. It crashes when I try to 'agree' on the terms of agreement page. I even tried 'cancel' just in case it was somehow switched\, but no luck. Just can't open it.,US,2013-11-09 15:19:00,1,Anna ,Crashes when I 'agree',472014516,
13321,Can't use the app at all anymore with my older iPhone OS. Seriously stinks! No\, I don't want to update my OS.,US,2013-11-04 04:18:00,1,DRG3000,Can't use the app at all anymore with my older iPhone OS. Seriously stinks!,472014516,
13322,Shows about 8 items in any category before saying 'loading' which it never does. The shopping bag is difficult to manage\, and nearly impossible to scroll past the top two items in the bag. Awful. Gave two stars instead of one because it hasn't crashed. Yet.,US,2013-11-03 18:56:00,2,vankaypie,Inoperable,472014516,
13323,I had trouble getting the app to start up on my iPhone with the newest iOS 7 update\, but when I tried with an iPhone that didn't have the new update it was fast\, easy to access\, and not a single issue using it. Overall\, I think it's a useful app and well set up.,US,2013-11-03 16:49:00,4,Lon johnson,iOS 7,472014516,
13324,Crashes all the time,US,2013-11-03 06:31:00,1,Homepage?!,Stupid,472014516,
13325,Overall the app is great very user-friendly!I only experienced two issues with the app\, one being more user preference. When in an actual item to get out of it you have to click the X close button on the top right rather than a back button on the left. I habitually click on the top left and instead of going back to the items I was viewing\, it goes all the way to the beginning. It would be convenient to have a back button on the top left to go back to prior items. The second item impacts the checkout process and ultimately whether or not somebody might go through with the purchase. When trying to add a coupon code the keyboard did not pop up despite clicking inside and around the box. The same thing happened when I clicked on the manual adding of Kohl's cash\, although I'm sure there's another way to scan that. All in all definitely a fun user-friendly app!,US,2013-11-02 21:14:00,4,Ntaps,Great app\, only a couple things,472014516,
13326,I can't even get it to open\, it just keeps crashing! It keeps telling me to agree to the terms and conditions and as soon as I do it crashes. Useless!!,US,2013-10-30 15:55:00,1,Momto3Divas,Doesn't work,472014516,
13327,The up date my phone just forced me to do is horrible! I can't put anything in my shopping bag and everything that was in my shopping bag is saying it had an invalid sku. So irritated.,US,2013-10-30 15:36:00,1,Gmoney3377,Up date is horrible,472014516,
13328,I should have known better after reading other reviews. Downloaded app anyway . Shopped for 2 hours then couldn't access my shopping bag to check out. Had a coupon that was expiring so ordered through regular e mail site. Very frustrating! Deleted app.,US,2013-10-29 12:24:00,1,Debz4444,Waste of time!!!,472014516,
13329,Having trouble with using scanner app when scanning barcode on items\, went to 2 different kohls\, and both are coming up item not found 'help' or 'rescan'. Tried various products\, please look into\, with scanners in the store being scarce\, it was nice being able to use my iphone\, hope info helps fix bug,US,2013-10-28 01:53:00,3,Brownie Bo,Scanner problems,472014516,
13330,I can't offer much of a review - I put in my location then when I press 'agree' to terms it kicks me out. Never works.,US,2013-10-27 23:55:00,1,SilasBesse,Will not even open,472014516,
13331,Not worth one star! I can't even access the app. Everytime I press accept for the agreement and terms it crashes! Don't waste your time.,US,2013-10-26 19:04:00,1,Adrienne1222,HORRIBLE,472014516,
13332,You can't sign in to your account!!! Very irritating when it keeps having you to enter your info and it still gives you errors even after resetting your password.,US,2013-10-20 13:42:00,1,lil shots,Sign in does not work!!,472014516,
13333,They have made a lot of improvements.   However it's still a waste of time when you click on an item only to find it is no longer available. Just take it off!,US,2013-10-16 10:29:00,2,Newlife4cindy,Not a great app to shop with,472014516,
13334,Just downloaded this to maybe make shopping easier. I'm a stay at home mom of four children shopping is easier done from home. But I just downloaded this and it asked me to agree and as soon as I hit the agree button it closed the app!!!! I tried to use it ten times and it just won't work. Complete crap and waste of space and download time. Deleting.......,US,2013-10-16 04:36:00,1,Tj9296,Force closes immediately,472014516,
13335,This app is horrible\, plus the mobile version on my phone does not work as well. For goodness sake\, please fix!!!!,US,2013-10-14 01:58:00,1,Sessa20sd,Horrible!,472014516,
13336,At this point I am deleting the app. I've had it over a year hoping it would improve. But once again I spent time adding to my cart and at 20 items I went to check out and all but one item was deleted!!! Time wasted. Their loss......,US,2013-10-13 15:45:00,1,DrivingNikki12,You would think they would improve this!,472014516,
13337,This app is O.K. It needs some fixtures,US,2013-10-12 00:25:00,3,Crazy-about-apps-girl,App-maniac,472014516,
13338,This app has a lot of issues filtering things! I was able to use the browser faster than the app,US,2013-10-07 19:35:00,1,Ziggster1980,Lag,472014516,
13339,Poorly designed\, slow\, constantly closing out and not keeping anything in shopping bag. Really could use a complete overhaul! Other stores don't have this issue..,US,2013-10-06 03:33:00,1,tadrex88,Horrible!!,472014516,
13340,Unless every single item at every single Kohls is currently sold out\, their 'enhanced speed' with the latest upgrade is the result of the search engine failing to find anything. I'd give it zero stars if I could.,US,2013-10-04 15:13:00,1,Mthalo,Useless,472014516,
13341,Multiple issues with this app from shopping to checkout (it won't let you check out).  I still can't believe developers released this app with all the issues it has.  Their mobile site is just as bad.  I like kohls but they really need to step up their IT dept to say the least.,US,2013-10-04 14:42:00,1,Marc1777,Bad,472014516,
13342,Well when I try and pick a category it searches and nothing ever happens. Even it your searching for anything it tells you item not found. It's slow when u do get to see what your looking for and when loading more it takes forever. And when you open up any item and close it out you have to start over from the top. The app is crappy.,US,2013-10-03 10:54:00,1,Trouble123,Junk!!!!,472014516,
13343,I shop at kohls AT LEAST once a month. I find it very upsetting that their app is too difficult and time consuming to maneuver when I spend so much money there. You would think they wouldn't want to lose customers by their lack of staying up to date with the buyers :/,US,2013-09-29 16:46:00,1,EthanLovesYou,Disappointed,472014516,
13344,Frustrating to use & move around\, not smooth or easy to refine a search & the search settings reset if you go back or out of the app. Something that is easily fixed for an update\, hopefully\, and maybe I'll redownload it.,US,2013-09-28 16:03:00,2,CowgirlUp788,Frustrating to maneuver.,472014516,
13345,Poor performance\, frequent freezing and crashing and not user friendly. The search feature does not bring back results and I could not even locate my local store and hours. Embarrassing for a retailer of this size,US,2013-09-28 11:20:00,1,Steve5560,Terrible,472014516,
13346,Sorry kohls I will not use app. I will not give permission to tract my phone.,US,2013-09-28 01:17:00,1,S_B_C,Just another unhappy customer,472014516,
13347,Now they want to use location based service and you can only use the app if you agree. This means they want to track you and sell you info. No\, no\, no.,US,2013-09-26 21:41:00,1,Zchick1,Location Based Service Nonsense,472014516,
13348,Really difficult to navigate mostly because it crashed often. Many parts of the app don't work properly. Spend more time waiting for it to work then you'll do shopping. Save hassle and just find a desktop and hit the website.,US,2013-09-23 01:59:00,1,The dpc,Rough around the edges,472014516,
13349,Doesn't work on older iTouch/iPhones w/o latest O/S.  Now use apps for other stores which work just fine.  Another on-line customer lost.,US,2013-09-21 15:49:00,1,jobean63,Doesn't work,472014516,
13350,Was a little slow before but at least I could still see products. After the upgrade just get blank screens or a little spinning circle. No use at all now.,US,2013-09-20 06:24:00,1,AuntLisaGa,What happened with the upgrade?,472014516,
13351,This has to be the worst online shopping app I've ever used. I keep it on my phone in hopes kohls will fix it but after months they still haven't. I can never get it to actually follow through with a pitches and browsing for items is a total joke!! FIX THE FREAKING APP!!',US,2013-09-19 03:47:00,1,Cprescott80,Horrible and never works!,472014516,
13352,The app has always been difficult to navigate\, but was hoping the update would improve that. Turns out I can even place an order - says something about default shipping address. Ultimately I am giving up and walk to the store...,US,2013-09-18 07:00:00,1,EdiMex,Useless,472014516,
13353,Even after the update\, still unable to sign in. Also needs to be able to have access to registry via the app. By far the worst app on my phone.,US,2013-09-18 02:50:00,1,tfly89,By far the worst app,472014516,
13354,It asks to allow the app to use my Current location\, but when I close the app shortcut\, the location arrow still appears. I had to uninstall the app to get rid of it. I tested it out with other apps and the Location icon disappears after a few seconds.,US,2013-09-17 22:55:00,1,pillar81,Trash,472014516,
13355,The app works well for searching and shopping\, but any store that has registry capability should make the registry available in the app. You should be able to manage and view your wedding registry through the app. Every other store that has registry available makes it available in the app.,US,2013-09-17 21:33:00,2,Jtocco1,Ok but disappointing in comparison.,472014516,
13356,This is such a terrible app. They really need to pull it and take some time to rewrite it. It's a waste of time to use it. I'm going to leave it installed just so I'll know when there is an update...  I'd give it no stars if I could.,US,2013-09-16 12:19:00,1,Redi4spring,Terrible,472014516,
13357,Even if app is closed. Drains battery. Ive turned off location services for the app.,US,2013-09-15 15:40:00,1,Venezian,GPS is always ON,472014516,
13358,Search functionality is terrible (filtering\, can't return to results where you left off\, etc.).,US,2013-09-15 03:29:00,1,ss00009,Poor search functionality,472014516,
13359,iPhone seems to work okay with the app\, but relevance is spotty on searches and the app is not worth much other than looking at what might be available. Not useful for buying. I like Kohl's but the app designer needs to keep working.,US,2013-09-13 14:25:00,2,Troy5000,App works but not much else.,472014516,
13360,Get a programmer.  This app is horrible.,US,2013-09-13 03:27:00,1,Pearlie1234,Horrible,472014516,
13361,Not sure what all the fuss is about but the app works just fine for me.   I only give it 4 stars because there is nothing spectacular about it.  Your typical shopping app.,US,2013-09-12 23:43:00,4,jennimate,Works just fine,472014516,
13362,You can't pay your bill on this mobile app\, which is all I wanted to do. Don't bother\, just go back to the full website to shop and make payments. Looks like Kohl's is in need of some web mobile app developers-badly\, since they're probably all fired after this app was released.,US,2013-09-12 13:24:00,1,iPhone bill payer,Love Kohl's\, Bad mobile app!,472014516,
13363,Come on Kohls! Your app has gone from so-so to bad to worse! It's almost become useless. Can't sign in...can't shop...can't give you my business.,US,2013-09-12 05:50:00,1,Mel~Mac,Get with the program!,472014516,
13364,Can you make it able to pay my charge card on the app!!!,US,2013-09-12 01:25:00,2,Cuddlespandabear,Charge card,472014516,
13365,I would give it No stars at all if I could.  Just deleted off my phone.  Couldn't log in because it stated that my account is inaccessible at this time\,  try again later.  I HAVE been trying it later and it still gives me this message.  Love the store\, hate the app.  Fix it please...,US,2013-09-10 15:33:00,1,Dana1024,Horrible,472014516,
13366,Won't let me sign in so can't shop or view my account/ order status. Worthless! Already deleted it.,US,2013-09-10 02:16:00,1,Antonia44,Horrible app,472014516,
13367,I have tried multiple times to make this app work. At first I thought it was because I had a new account but one month later it did not work.,US,2013-09-09 23:34:00,1,Api74,This App does not work,472014516,
13368,This app was prompting location services to activate but without successfully turning back off. Battery drainer. I had to manually turn off this apps access to location services to get it to stop its constant searching and draining procedure.,US,2013-09-07 16:21:00,1,Randomonious,Location services is buggy,472014516,
13369,Just removed this app. I am using data manager to control my data usage and I found that this app using my data while the app is not running. That's why I got an alert about the drals from Kohls while I am close to the store.,US,2013-09-07 13:15:00,1,KhMeRAk,Watch your data usage..,472014516,
13370,Doesn't you sign in\, Kohl's charge just opens Safari\, and no where to store or view active coupons. Deleted app already.,US,2013-09-07 12:40:00,1,Johnson2011,Lame App,472014516,
13371,Hoped the glitches might be fixed but found 'not'\, at least for me.  Was unable to log onto my account from the get-go\, however searching items on the site worked OK.  This has potential to be as great as the website used with computers\, though my experience of managing my account from my mobile device proved futile whether attempted with the App or going to their website from Safari.  Hope to find a fix available soon.,US,2013-09-05 04:48:00,2,Nanette Eldridge-Barone,Don't Expect Great Things... Yet,472014516,
13372,This app is complete garbage! I can't do anything!!! It even uses my GPS when I've closed out the app. How is that possible?!?! Waiting my battery for no reason!! Don't do it!!!!!,US,2013-09-04 20:55:00,1,KikiAnaRose,Horrendous,472014516,
13373,It's really pity to see such a non responsive app from Kohls.. It keeps spinning forever.. Needs to be redesigned from start..Updated Sep2013- still spinning!! Worst  ever shopping app..,US,2013-09-04 03:06:00,1,Jak.25,Crappy App,472014516,
13374,I can't sign in anymore and all customer service tells me to do is delete and reinstall the app which does nothing.  Also when you view an item\, then close it\, you lose the spot in the viewing list.  It makes me want to not use this app at app.  Kohl's is a big enough company to invest and get their app figured out.,US,2013-09-04 00:29:00,1,Oceanroots,This app is terrible,472014516,
13375,I will go with the other reviews... I love Kohl's\, but this app can use some work!!!:) it is very slow and crashes a lot and has only a little bit of the stuff that the website does... But I did find some nice stuff and I also found the perfect b-day gift for my brother...so I'm going to give it a 3 star!!!,US,2013-09-03 02:48:00,3,Coolckick,Eh...,472014516,
13376,This app gets worse & worse over time! Harder to navigate\, no back arrows/previous page\, can't sign in\, can't browse categories because there is no way out of a specific category. Will find somewhere else to shop on my iphone!,US,2013-09-02 16:10:00,1,julie585,Every version worse than previous,472014516,
13377,Lots of incompetence. Will no longer shop here.,US,2013-09-01 23:04:00,1,Jhn333,Disaster,472014516,
13378,I am unable to sign in\, this is unacceptable.,US,2013-08-31 14:36:00,1,HamerTime1993,Ridiculous,472014516,
13379,I just spent 45 minutes shopping on the app at 6:00am only to be told at checkout there is an issue and I need to call customer service. I had all the other issues mentioned by others as well. Being a software engineer that works with iphone apps I am disappointed to see the quality of this app so low. It will by no means affect my shopping at Kohls\, however I strongly suggest they fix this app up ASAP.,US,2013-08-31 14:11:00,1,MissKohls,Not So Happy,472014516,
13380,I saw the negative reviews and took a risk to try it out. It's okay\, it loads and brings everything up\, but its REALLY slow and My wifi is great and never slow for me :/ Would advise them to fix it if they can because this app would be very helpful for those who shop here all the time.,US,2013-08-30 21:11:00,3,Retro-gamer93,It's okay,472014516,
13381,Worst store app I've ever used. Not worthy of the Kohl's brand.,US,2013-08-30 12:45:00,1,Logan Johnson,Impossible to use,472014516,
13382,This app is terrible. I can't log in. Every time I try it tells me my account is inaccessible. It is also very slow. This app needs a lot of help,US,2013-08-29 13:27:00,1,Bjarnold,Terrible,472014516,
13383,I love kohls\, but the app is horrible. I can't sign in\, which is the biggest problem. Other than that\, the annoyances are that you can't select an item\, and go back to your last position in a list; you're always thrown back to the beginning. Very annoying if you're on 'page 4 of 5'. Also\, the app has only a fraction of what is actually offered online. All in all\, this app is just frustrating. Oh yeah\, one more: the scanning feature. Extremely annoying when you scan something in the store\, and the app has NO IDEA what you're looking for. 'Item not found'. IT'S IN YOUR STORE!!!,US,2013-08-27 04:43:00,1,Viccivale,Fix this app!!,472014516,

13386,I'm trying to give you my hard-earned money here\, Kohl's! I never even write reviews. Force-closes every time I open it. Awful. Would give 0 stars if I could.,US,2013-08-21 20:18:00,1,SheRa360,Worst. App. Ever.,472014516,
13387,Can't login\, can't checkout\, can't check order status even with the order number from Kohls. Nothing but error messages and wasted time. Love Kohls but this app needs fixing!!,US,2013-08-21 13:01:00,1,Kanoa07,Not impressed so far,472014516,
13388,I can't sign in. It seems like many users have this problem and it's not being fixed. There are reviews stating this problem as a main concern from over a month ago..,US,2013-08-20 17:10:00,1,AshleePayge,Nope,472014516,
13389,App is horrible! You can fill up your cart but when you go to checkout everything shows up red and says there is a network error and that you need to call customer service to purchase your items. If I wanted to purchase my items over the phone I wouldn't have the app!!!,US,2013-08-20 15:41:00,1,Very frustrated customer!!,Ugh!!!,472014516,

13391,Kohls deals are really great at times.  Love the Kohls Cash and the promo codes and the percent offs.BUTthis app is just bad.  It stopped loading my cart.  It also does not link with my online account when I am on my PC.PLUSanother person is right about the search --when you go back to your search results\, it starts all the way at the beginning again.What is the deal Kohls?  Fix it please.,US,2013-08-17 22:07:00,2,Lightboxr,What is up with Kohls?,472014516,
13392,AS IF the iPhone 5 didn't already have battery life issues\, along comes Kohls with an app that wants to keep location services on ALL THE TIME! Love the store\, but this app is en epic fail!,US,2013-08-15 15:51:00,1,Backtalker,Seriously?,472014516,
13393,This app has a mind of its own and closes on me all the time.  It's very unreliable and frustrating.  When it works (rarely)\, it's fine.,US,2013-08-14 11:24:00,2,Farkler33,Constantly shuts down,472014516,

13395,Site told me I couldn't log in. I tried to make a purchase as a guest and it was so slow that by the time I went to complete my order\, the item was sold out. They really need to read the reviews. Pointless site.,US,2013-08-13 03:52:00,1,spygurl,Kohl's is losing $$$$!,472014516,
13396,When I click to look at an item and go back it scrolls all the way to the top. So then I have to scroll all the way back down like 50 time!!! I wish you fix it!!! It's sooooo annoying that I'd rather go online to look at items then this stupid app!!! Fix it and we'll all be happy!,US,2013-08-12 15:28:00,1,FrankReveles,Annoying search,472014516,
13397,The app is so slow. I wish that I could search my brand though!,US,2013-08-12 03:30:00,1,aecatalan,SLOOOOOOOW,472014516,

13400,Deleting,US,2013-08-04 20:59:00,1,Bb76666,Awful,472014516,
13401,I rarely write negative reviews-- but this app needs to be updated!! So slow and lags a lot. Confusing to use and randomly shuts down!,US,2013-08-04 19:19:00,1,Patricia Hosking,Horrible,472014516,
13402,Frustrating to have to scroll through the entire sale list again (while it freezes) after you choose to look at an item.,US,2013-08-04 09:27:00,1,Henrythegreatness,Freezes. No memory.,472014516,
13403,Deleting NOW! Won't recognize my Kohl's password even after I've changed it multiple times.,US,2013-08-03 18:13:00,1,Meema48,Horrible!!!!,472014516,
13404,If I could give this app a negative number of stars I would. Others covered the main points but I wanted to add one. When I finally got logged in\, I went to check my order status. Instead of showing any of MY orders it showed someone else's order (confirmed that it had not been placed under my account by being hacked\, my first worry\, by calling CS) she was so nonchalant about the sharing of account info like it was no big deal. Really Kohls?,US,2013-08-02 15:52:00,1,A2stylist,Uhg! Just awful.,472014516,
13405,Hardly even functions. You would think that a company hoping to make a profit would create an app that allows you to easily make purchases. Instead it just times out 80% of the time.,US,2013-08-02 10:51:00,1,Addicted to this app!,Horrible app.,472014516,
13406,I used to find this app tolerable but every update becomes slower\, more buggy\, and less user friendly.  Currently my shopping cart icon shows 5 items but when I open the cart to check out it says it's empty. I am also trying to add more items but the button does not function. Loading times are horrendous and every time you open an item you are returned to the first result.  This app is an embarrassment and without a doubt its shortcomings are costing Kohls a lot of potential business.,US,2013-08-02 03:53:00,1,KKrissss,Every update gets worse,472014516,
13407,I love Kohls and ordered from their regular online site before\, but the mobile app kept telling me my session expired due to inactivity each time I tried adding something to my cart so I thought I would try this app.  Why would a large retail company allow such an awful app to be released?  Just to keep up with the other big dogs?  I hate retail apps like this one that when you look at an item and return to your list \, it goes all the way to the top. It doesn't have pages to stop this. So if you are looking at item 80 of 100\, to see the next 20 in the list\, you have to re-scroll again thru all 80. Also\, if you want to apply a filter\, I finally realized you have to do it twice for it to REALLY filter. I finally added a few items to my bag but wanted to login online to complete my purchase since I got frustrated so I logged out of the app only to get a message that an error occurred and to order these items I would have to call customer service. Really?  All that and I lose my bag?  Very very frustrating.  Kohl's\, how many purchases will you lose because of this?!,US,2013-08-02 02:04:00,1,Packoparks,Please fix this app and/or online mobile site!,472014516,
13408,Useless\, does not allow me to login !!! One star just for the reason to submit the review!!!,US,2013-08-01 02:03:00,1,Neenik,Useless,472014516,

13410,It's becomes very tedious to shop with this app. It's slow. Sometimes it doesn't even load. It gets very annoying.,US,2013-07-29 05:23:00,2,Dhubskbddjbfdgycsbb,Difficult to navigate,472014516,
13411,Despite all the bad reviews\, I happen to like it.,US,2013-07-29 03:13:00,5,kjhammond,Good app!!,472014516,
13412,There is no app feedback to Kohls right from the app\, so I have to leave it here. I had to turn location services off & I'll manually turn it on when at the store (what a pain\, takes away the usefulness of a SMART phone) if you don't turn it off\, it stays on ALL the time even when not near the store which is a battery drain. Please fix!I haven't tried ordering anything\, but from the other reviews that doesn't look so good either.,US,2013-07-28 15:01:00,2,BwtrMom,Location Services stays on,472014516,
13413,This app does not work period.  If you have a acct. (probably like most people who want this try this app) with Kohl's you are better off using Safari to go to Kohl's main web site to sign in.  This does Not work.  And the star rating should be Zero.,US,2013-07-25 18:05:00,1,ematk1,Does Not Work,472014516,
13414,Everything was going fine until I went to checkout a pair of earrings I was trying to buy. Went to press 'review order' and it wouldn't do a thing. Went back a page to see if I could just go through it again\, but this time\, it wouldn't let me check out. I finally gave up. Your loss\, Kohls.,US,2013-07-25 16:40:00,1,Emily848939273849,Thanks for letting me checkout...not.,472014516,

13416,The app didn't recognize my password. I requested a temp password in which they emailed to me. When I tried the temp password\, it told me it was invalid. Additionally\, if I tried to add something to the shopping bag\, it took me to the home page. It was very frustrating. I will be deleting this app.,US,2013-07-23 13:56:00,1,XTimmay,Doesn't allow sign-in,472014516,
13417,Can't sign in\, so what's the point?,US,2013-07-23 02:49:00,1,AmyRocha,Can't sign in,472014516,
13418,Can someone tell me what an invalid token is,US,2013-07-22 23:20:00,1,Hdhahawow,Can't even log in,472014516,
13419,Tried shopping on my iPhone for my kids some school clothes. I wanted to use a code that expired at 3 pm\, had to first make a new account because it kept telling me invalid token. After finding what I wanted I tried checking out but wouldn't load my check out screen. Goodbye $200 sale for you Kohls. App fail.,US,2013-07-22 21:39:00,1,Ang-me,Horrible,472014516,
13420,I love Kohl's but the app stinks. When you open the page for a particular item and then want to go back to where you left off in the search results\, it takes you back to the very beginning if the results instead. The pages also take a long time to load. I finally gave up and went to the website to browse. These are just  a couple of the app's problems.,US,2013-07-22 16:18:00,2,Becky Larrabee,Lousy app,472014516,
13421,If I could give 0 stars I would. The app doesn't work any better than their horrible website. No online shopping at Kohls...,US,2013-07-21 21:10:00,1,angrygirl,Worthless,472014516,
13422,Invalid token? I try to log in and I'm told I have an invalid token!!??  Slow searches. Very annoying. Please fix it.,US,2013-07-20 23:30:00,1,Seg2003,Fix it!!,472014516,
13423,Here's the scene:I'm comfortably stretched out on the couch\, casually tapping on the Kohls app which lives a sheltered life in my one and only app folder. I had just made some tea\, so I was in a great mood and my tolerance for any\, minor or major annoyance had gone up hight do to my boosted spirits.The app loads up\, slower then most of my apps. It was an app I had recently downloaded. Kohls.'Sometimes\, my phone acts slow when I don't have wifi.' I thought to myself\, forcing my eyes to scan the phone for the small logo indicating the connection level. Adjusting my position on the couch\, I was surprised by the result of my recent eye move-age...I had full wifi\, and my 3G is always on.So why this app was being slow was a mystery to me.Mood? Went from 10 to 7But still\, I persevered eager to find some cute clothing for this summer since I have nothing in my closet.Looking down at myself disappoints me since I am in the same outfit I have been wearing all week: a tee shirt from my elementary school (I'm small) and shorts that weren't even mine... They were my friends that she left here a while ago.Whatever\, it's a lazy day.So you can see why I have been excited at the impending thought of blowing various gift cards I had received.I scrolled under the section of clothes that I would most likely be interested in in\, Juniors\, and scrolled. The pictures along side the description were being really slow.Like turtle on a rock in the Sahara dessert in slow motion slow.Yup. That slow.Finally\, after three commercials flew by it loaded up! My heart kept\, excitedly comprehending what was taking place on my small device. The first couple were casual wear\, nothing special like the things I've seen hanging on the racks when I walk into Kohls.As I kept scrolling\, the pictures stopped loading but the text beside the pixel filled cubes stayed.I read something that interested me. Then two. Then three! All in a row\, the hoping-Ly fashionable items sat before me.But the pictures wouldn't load up\, and I couldn't do anything about it.My jaw dropped\, my now- numb fingers dropped my phone\, brushing my rib cage.'IM SO PICKY. AND WHEN I READ SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS CUTE... GAHHHHH!!' That's my mind process as I wheezed upon impact of my Otterbox incased device.*************************************************I hope you guys fix the app\, because i love Kohls. My two favorite items in my wardrobe come from there:A pink sweater that says MeowA gray jacketSo please fix it!KOHLS HAS BEEN-writereviewed©Write Review© reviews apps and uses their creative writing skills to come up with a narrative on their experience with the app\, good or bad\, hopefully utilizing metaphors and descriptive language to let the reader of these reviews know what type of app they are in for. Thanks for reading!,US,2013-07-20 21:55:00,2,photographerperson,a writereview©,472014516,
13424,I'd like the app a whole lot more if it would let me log in. I copy/pasted the password sent to me by Kohl's (twice) and it's still saying 'invalid'. Useful for looking up items\, but I can use Safari for that. So\, deleting the app.,US,2013-07-20 17:00:00,2,MScooch,Password...?,472014516,
13425,Horribly slow\, horribly designed app...I love kohls but Every time I want to shop\, I get disappointed and close the app halfway when things don't work the way they are supposed to work... Hoping to see it work well soon...,US,2013-07-19 19:39:00,1,ssgp,Horrible,472014516,
13426,I was on the app less than 5 minutes and I already hated it! It's so slow and whenever u scroll down it will freeze. You do not want this app,US,2013-07-19 19:28:00,1,Bcl.,WORST APP EVER,472014516,
13427,I love Kohls...hate the app! Limited search criteria\, and when you look at an item in your search list\, you have to start at the beginning of the list again when you go back.  So annoying and time consuming!,US,2013-07-18 11:31:00,2,RoxYourSox,Kohls App,472014516,
13428,I've dead the reviews and am a but shocked. I have not encountered any glitches. If app is running slow just double press home button and kill background process to speed up.,US,2013-07-16 14:37:00,5,PsnID- outaku,Wonderful app!,472014516,
13429,Didn't believe the other reviews but wow\, were they right. Worst app I've ever downloaded. Wouldn't even have given it 1 star but I was forced to give it something. Should be negative 5 stars!,US,2013-07-15 19:33:00,1,Jirly,Terrible!!!!,472014516,
13430,I am deleting this app.    Tried for over an hour to order\, slow\, then showed my shopping cart was empty when I tried to checkout.   Kohls just lost over a $100 of my business...,US,2013-07-15 02:47:00,1,On to something else,This app is awful,472014516,
13431,If would be possible I wouldn't even give one star! There are a lot of problems with this application. And it is really annoying to use. My last experience was horrible so I decided to write all about it! After spending almost an hour adding stuff to the basket\, everything disappeared and it said that my session was discontinued for my own protection\, just because I didn't use it for a while! Which wasn't even the truth. The website was slow because it had a sell!. Even with me signing in\, it didn't save the basket. Another example is the problem with going back to previous page. It is set for only 12 items to show per page\, with no option to change it. Let's say you move on to item number 50 and you want to look at it. After you done and you go back\, it brings you to the first page. You have to go page by page to you reach that item again\, so you can look at the items that are listed after this one. This is just two examples. I could write on and on about the others. Please save yourself the trouble and use your desktop\, it works much better.,US,2013-07-14 00:08:00,1,Messie8,Worst retail app ever!,472014516,
13432,This app is terrible! It crashes frequently\, it doesn't save my shopping bag\, it is EXTREMELY slow\, When I search and scroll down\, it starts from the top again. I hope you guys can fix these issues. It seems as if everyone else has the same! I would love to have an online shopping app\, but this one I have to delete! Is does not function properly.,US,2013-07-13 11:32:00,1,Baby.Boo24,Kohls.,472014516,
13433,1. The app NEVER lets go of your GPS. Even after you've completely closed down the app. Way to waste battery life\, Kohl's!2. The search feature is annoying. When you view the details of an item and go back to the search results\, you have to start at the top again. I didn't order anything as they (surprisingly) didn't have what I was looking for last night\, so I can't speak to the issues others seem to be having with the cart or order process. But don't let this app use your location -- you'll end up with no battery left faster than you'll realize.,US,2013-07-12 12:36:00,1,Starwarschica,Location Service Bug & other problems,472014516,
13434,I rarely review apps\, but I have to on this one because I was disappointed. It is extremely slow\, even on a very fast connection\, and like other reviewers have noted the searches Bring you back to the top of the list if you look at any item.  With lots of search results\, that is not a very efficient system for navigation. I also find the filters to be limited.  I love kohls so I hope they improve this app. But I won't be using it anytime soon.,US,2013-07-08 22:51:00,2,Mhlmom,Slow and navigation issues,472014516,
13435,I just downloaded it. It has crashed three times. It is slow. I hope they fix it because the filters are good and very detailed.,US,2013-07-08 02:50:00,1,Bernamac,Waste of time,472014516,

13437,This app has caused me to lose out on sales as it doesn't order my entire order then by the time the order arrives in the mail\, the sail is over. I've used 100's of apps since I got the original iPhone right after it was released. This one is bar far the worst! I would give it no stars if that were an option.,US,2013-07-07 13:46:00,1,amber p,Worst app I've come across EVER,472014516,

13440,I NEVER leave reviews\, but in this case I MUST! A) if you click on an item to view it and you are on page 15 in your scrolling process\, it will send you back to ONE every single time when you go back to scrolling through items! Sooo frustrating to have to start ALLL over each time! B) will not let me add a payment option while trying to check out! C) soooooooooooo sloooooooooooooowFIX IT and ill use it DAILY!

13442,I have been waiting and waiting for either the website or this app to fix the difficult search through products. I rarely buy anything at Kohls because if I click on anything I may be interested in and then return to the search results I have to start at the top of the list again. This is terribly annoying and a huge waste of time. Most of the time I just give up because I get so frustrated.,US,2013-07-03 02:16:00,3,SChristieS,Maddening Searches,472014516,
13443,This is probably the worst shopping app I've used. It takes forever to look at anything. I get so frustrated I end up closing it before I ever do d anything. It reminds me of the days of dial up Internet.,US,2013-07-01 22:53:00,1,Lalalalalalalala. . .,Love to shop,472014516,

13445,It's so annoying to browse items on the app. When you return to the main page or the search results\, you have to scroll through the same items until you get to the last item you looked at. It should bookmark where you left to avoid this. Ugh!!,US,2013-06-29 03:24:00,1,melz1225,EPIC FAIL!,472014516,

13447,This app is the most annoying. Once you check on an item and go back to your searches it brings you to the very top of the list. To top it all\, it is very slow which makes this app totally useless!! If there's a score below one star\, this is it!! Too bad coz i love shopping at Kohls but I'm deleting this app after this review!,US,2013-06-27 17:12:00,1,ElroiMO,Most annoying app award!,472014516,

13452,An app should be better than the mobile version of the website. That's the whole point of using the app instead of the actual site. This app is worse. Everything is too slow when loading and often never finishes loading. It doesn't save your browsing place when you look at an item and go back causing you to have to reload countless items you already saw.

13458,Kohls needs to get a more experienced web developer!!   Seriously! Or? Someone with a more creative mindset.  Come on! Unless they just DON'T CARE about their customers who go online. Which in these days are a lot.,US,2013-06-05 17:48:00,1,Norozco,Website,472014516,
13459,I went on to find shorts for my daughter. Clicked on kids thinking they'd give me an option for girls and then maybe have me select the size I need. Nope! It showed me categories of clothes and when I choose shorts I would have to go through every size and gender of shorts. No thanks\, no time. I'll go to the store. Like the idea of coupon coming to app. I lose mine :)Keeping trying Kohl's\, we like you otherwise.

But\, amazingly enough\, I check my account today and the order apparently did not take. Unfortunately\, I had already discarded my Kohl's cash assuming everything was fine because I had seen an order confirmation screen the night before on the app. To compound the problem\, I trusted that the app had stored that confirmation information. I'm not saying that I should not have been more diligent in making sure to write down the confirmation number\, etc.  But\, nevertheless\, I will NEVER\, EVER use this app again.

I closed it out completely after about 20 minutes of waiting.  Open back up - my cart is empty!! Are you kidding me?! Next day - open the app again\, Lo and behold\, 22 items are in my cart.

13483,I really wish this app did not have all the bugs that it does. I love to shop on my phone and I love to shop at Kohls\, but I do not love this app. Kicks you out right in the middle of shopping\, takes forever to load a product or new page\, pics do not show enough details of the products and when you go back to a main screen from a product it takes you back to the very beginning - does not remember where you were in your search.

13484,I downloaded this app despite previous poor ratings because it had an update since the last review was posted. This app works fine - even lists online exclusive products. It does still seem to have a problem when you use the back/previous subcategory feature after viewing a product - you're taken back to the TOP of the list. I didn't mind at first\, but when I was looking at rings\, this feature became annoying. There were so many rings to scroll back through it took some time to get back to where I left off.

I may have been on dress #125 down the list but after clicking to view it and then going back to the list I'm back on dress #1. Then I have to scroll all the way down to dress #125 to pick up where I left off. This is extremely annoying. It makes me not want to use the app at all. Please update this.

13486,Terrible! I've never written a review before but this one earned it.  App 'times out' when you switch to any other page or whenever it feels like it\, can't access registries\, and once you put something in your bag- expect it to stay there.  Even if you remove it in one session\, the next time you get on it will still be there.  For a nation-wide well-known business their technology is really lacking!  Pathetic and they should be embarrassed.,US,2013-04-16 17:40:00,1,Mz amazin,Worthless,472014516,

13488,The app could use some improvements but overall it does the job if you know what you want to get.  It takes too long to browse! It's not as bad as everyone is reviewing.

13489,This app is ridiculous. Every search results in the biggest delay or crash\, going back always starts you at the beginning. Who created this a four year old? What a waste of time creating something that is so behind in programming. Hope you didn't pay that guy. This app needs a major over haul or just someone that knows how to write proper code. It's stupidly slow and lacks basic things that an app needs. Waste. Makes a person want to not order because it is downright time consuming and frustrating and pointless with this application.

13495,I get so frustrated using this app that I just quit shopping. I delete an item and then next time I open the app\, it is always back in my cart. If I've signed in on the site using my laptop\, the items I've added into my cart there don't show up when I am signed into the app and vice versa. Currently I have 3 items in my cart on the app and I'm trying to remove one and it won't scroll to the third item that I'm wanting to delete. Browsing for items is sooooooo slowwwwww. This part needs to be completely redone. Browsing on your desktop site is a much better experience.,US,2013-04-06 16:05:00,1,Dreamn34,This app needs some serious help,472014516,
13496,When browsing\, every time you click on an item to get more details and then go back it takes you all the way to the top of the list again. NOT COOL if you're on item 275 of 300. Then you have to scroll all the way down again and wait for all the pages to load...AGAIN. Ridiculous. Also\, when you're scrolling\, whatever item your thumb happens to hit as you scroll grays out so you can't see it.,US,2013-04-05 01:02:00,2,Mommy of newborn,Wastes my time,472014516,

13498,This app is pretty useless\, because what I really wanted it for was to be able to pay my monthly Kohl's charge payments on my phone.

13516,In theory\, an app. for any store is the new way to sell your merchandise\, practically everyone uses their smartphone to do everything. I said 'in theory' because at this time I've found the Kohl's app. frustrating! When browsing the merchandise I'll find an item I'm interested in and either want to add it to my cart or find out further details and choose the link to take me to that item (this part works fine). It's when I want to go back to search for other items I'm interested in that is the issue. Instead of taking me back where I left off at it sends me all the way back to the very first item!  Who wants to go through hundreds of items just to get back to where you originally left off...over...and over...and over again.  Please fix this issue!!!! Once this is fixed I would likely give this app 4 stars!,US,2013-03-07 02:23:00,1,preshsprncs,Frustrated\, please fix this issue!!!!,472014516,

13532,Love Kohl's and was glad to find the app. After I downloaded it\, I was instantly disappointed. When I pressed 'Shop'\, it was taking forever to download. I had time to go back and read the reviews and found others were disappointed as well. I reopened the app (was still loading\, by the way) and deleted it. I'll just stick to browsing online....,US,2013-02-15 07:39:00,1,mitcjayn,Way too slow,472014516,
13533,I had high hopes for this\, hearing it was just redesigned\, but every time I click on 'shop' and any of the categories\, it takes forever to load.  It makes me want to give up before I even start shopping.  And I love Kohl's.  But why have an app at all if it's only going to frustrate your clientele??,US,2013-02-13 00:27:00,1,pbag078,Takes forever to load,472014516,
13534,I cann't make a charge payment- the app refers u to their website. No no no good. I'm uninstalling,US,2013-02-12 12:19:00,1,ScrappHappy,No good for me,472014516,
13535,It's really pretty good but… I 10% of the time it's slow and 90% of the time it's fast. And bye the way... DON'T LISTEN 2  ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO RATE IT 1 STAR!!!!! they're just grumpy.,US,2013-02-10 13:48:00,4,Kitten340,Pretty good but... And bye the way...,472014516,
13536,Please fix it and make it so we can check our kohls charge,US,2013-02-10 06:47:00,1,Tony922223435,Terrible,472014516,
13537,Wish you can pay your bill on the app like other retail store,US,2013-02-10 06:02:00,1,Rebecca Ramirez,Blah,472014516,
13538,I cannot begin to tell you how poor this app functions\, even the survey portion of the app\, intent on hopefully making the site better\, functioned poorly.  App takes a year and a day to go from page to page\, and as a cardholder\, no access to my account details! A complete waste of time as an app\, I hope the company takes notice\, but I highly doubt it.,US,2013-02-09 16:20:00,1,blacklost,Worst store app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,472014516,
13539,This app is set up poorly.  Definitely didn't like how you had to narrow your search so far.  Not good for browsing.  I didn't keep it long enough to test anything else!,US,2013-02-09 13:08:00,1,Kbt1280,Deleted in 3 minutes,472014516,
13540,Glad to finally have an app to shop sales from my iPhone/iPad! No problems with it crashing yet\, iPhone 4S on wifi with most recent iOS update installed.  The 'load time' from shop to a different category and within category items does seem slower. Additionally\, I do wish the 'my kohls charge' was built in the app and not redirected to safari because I can load that without the app. Overall\, glad to have it and I'm going to keep shopping!,US,2013-02-07 20:30:00,4,Cjanl,Working smoothly here!,472014516,
13541,This is probably the worst shopping app ever.,US,2013-02-07 19:34:00,1,Not that patient,Don't bother,472014516,
13542,So after reading MANY of the reviews saying how it crashes\, you can't use the search\, can see what's in your 'bag' I haven't had any problems other than a slower page load time. With that said it didn't time out or crash... Liked that there are many filter choices except there is no boy/girl option for weeding thru clothing.. I like that it gives you a 'my store' option but was hoping it would have 'in stock/out of stock' for your selected store. It seems like an app for mainly online shopping\, since I have a kohls less than 5 miles from me the steep shipping deters me from purchasing online unless its a must have online only product. App used on iPhone 4 software 6.0.1,US,2013-02-07 19:31:00,3,Mommanikk,Not as bad as what the reviews say,472014516,
13543,This app is terrible,US,2013-02-07 05:21:00,1,X23th,Awful,472014516,
13544,Crashes immediately upon loading. Did anyone even bother to test this new update?,US,2013-02-07 02:47:00,1,IndyB5,Do not update!,472014516,
13545,Crashes every time I open it.,US,2013-02-07 00:38:00,1,jebakerii,Doesn't work,472014516,
13546,They have FINALLY had an update and the app is working again.,US,2013-02-06 22:04:00,4,Charlene Davina,Updated,472014516,
13547,Today's update did not help.  This app is still horrible.  Worthless!,US,2013-02-06 21:15:00,1,App lady 1,Horrible\, even after the update!,472014516,
13548,Thus has got to be one of the worst performing apps. Takes forever to load and then crashes constantly. how about an update?,US,2013-02-05 14:28:00,1,XXCBrian,Horrid!,472014516,
13549,Seriously the WORST app ever created.  Put items in my bag but then I can't see what is in the bag until I create an account. I create an account and I still can't see what I am ordering or even check out!!! I could have driven to the store\, shopped and stood in line on Black Friday and been done quicker and happier.,US,2013-02-04 20:04:00,1,XSCHETZ,This app will make you want to murder your phone,472014516,
13550,Worst app out there\, nothing works.  search functioning doesn't work or the bar code scanner.,US,2013-02-02 17:42:00,1,Colleen Johnson,Awful,472014516,
13551,The app is as cheap as the store!,US,2013-02-02 03:47:00,1,barbaqribs,No shock here,472014516,
13552,Hello app support!!!?!?!? Anyone out there!?! Need to fix your app\, it's not worked for months. Probably missing out on some sales $$$$,US,2013-01-28 13:52:00,1,Chad Shepard,App does not work!!,472014516,
13553,When you try to search for products\, it freezes and doesn't let you open the results.,US,2013-01-27 15:28:00,1,PD25,Love the store\, HATE the App!,472014516,
13554,This app is terrible! It times out\, returning me to the search page... Which is not useful at all. Don't waste your time downloading it. I'm deleting as soon as I finish this review.,US,2013-01-26 15:29:00,1,DC Female,Worth less than 1 star,472014516,
13555,Don't download this app. Just wasting time !!! This app even can't get one star.,US,2013-01-25 01:03:00,1,International caller 55,Annoying app,472014516,
13556,Disclosure: I love shopping at Kohls. Great service\, great service\, good prices. That said\, this app is the worst retail app I've ever used. Yes\, it's that bad.,US,2013-01-20 05:33:00,1,Dwight Johnson,Stupid app from great store...,472014516,
13557,I used to use the app all the time\, but after the last update\, the search function is worthless. Nothing gets done and it's very frustrating to see it not get fixed. It's been months with this broken feature and no signs of improvement navigating any other way,US,2013-01-14 04:37:00,1,Christina T,Pointless,472014516,
13558,this app doesnt work,US,2013-01-13 20:40:00,1,Boogerpicker7568,stinks,472014516,
13559,Whether it's barcode or verbiage all search results come up 'Show next 24 results' but no results show up rendering this portion of the app less than useless.,US,2013-01-12 22:30:00,1,GregCFP,Search doesn't work,472014516,
13560,Then I updated it & now the search feature is useless\, yields no results for common items or says 24 results yet lists nothing. Deleted it!,US,2013-01-10 16:49:00,1,Fieraxxi,Was working fine...,472014516,
13561,I received a gift card for Kohl's for my birthday so I downloaded this app. It's too slow & then times out. Searching for 'boots' yielded zero results\, going to the category shoes>boots yielded selections which included home\, petites and plus-size (for shoes/boots!) I never got to see any boots . I deleted this app - their website is frustrating enough already.,US,2013-01-10 11:12:00,1,sudawn,Frustrating & Useless,472014516,
13562,This app is pretty much useless. Normally I hate navigating through the Kohls website so I saw the icon to download the app and thought I would try my luck. Its even worse. Search function never works and the category search is embarrassingly difficult to navigate. Perhaps the button to download the app from the App Store should actually launch the App Store and not iTunes.,US,2013-01-07 17:42:00,1,Kristin Kullinger,Terrible,472014516,
13563,I never write reviews... I love Kohls and how they stand by the products that they carry. I'm hoping by seeing this review along with the others that they'll update the app and fix the search option which hasn't worked since I downloaded it. As noted by others for now skip the app and search on the Kohls website.Once an update comes out that fixes this issue I'll revisit this review and stars.,US,2013-01-06 13:50:00,1,Ian Sane - BHM,Search?,472014516,
13564,Still trying to figure out if this app does anything right.,US,2013-01-06 04:07:00,1,dgrec3,Awful,472014516,
13565,This app is awful! I deleted it and just use my browser. It works 100x better!,US,2013-01-05 19:59:00,1,Summersparkles23,Practically useless,472014516,
13566,This app worked as well as their mobile site (which needs some work in usability) UNTIL I tried to check out.  That's when everything blew up.  I was never able to check out and I couldn't get to my cart items even if I logged in through the website.  From a sales standpoint\, the part where you take the money really should be working.  Kind of defeats the shopping purpose\, no?,US,2013-01-01 21:53:00,2,Expectngmama,Disappointing,472014516,
13567,Absolutely terrible app. The search and scan option is useless. I tried searching for several items and didn't get any results. Then by going through the list I found one of the toys I was looking for. Tried searching for the exact name listed and still it found no results. No link to tell me if the item is available in my local store or not. Skip this one until Kohl's joins the rest of us in the 21st Century.,US,2013-01-01 20:16:00,1,gandalf1974blahblah,Why is there no ZERO star option?,472014516,
13568,While I do love Kohls the App leaves something to be desired.. Could u make it so that while I'm browsing & I click a product that it doesn't take me back to the top of the list of items I was just @?!? Take me back to where I left off browsing.. Same if I add to my shopping cart\, a continue shopping button would be nice & take me back to where I was.. Also the App Support button next to Write A Review takes you to Kohls site support which has nothing to do w/ the App.. Just my thoughts..,US,2013-01-01 17:13:00,3,Mommaclutz,Love Kohls,472014516,
13569,Slow app and neither search nor scan feature returns results. I scanned items in the store and get nothing\, and the in store kiosk scanner works fine. Just use the kiosk.,US,2013-01-01 14:54:00,1,SmarderDenYew,Don't bother with this one,472014516,
13570,Not worth the space on your phone. The 'shop' tab does not take you to a convent drop menu but just the actual homepage of kohl's. really? Don't have software guys that could've put together a decent app for your consumers. If this is the best your people can do maybe it's time to look for new people. Cuz this right here. Is a joke!,US,2013-01-01 14:15:00,1,LifeSaver42,Wow! What a piece of GARBAGE!,472014516,
13571,This app was useless!!! It kept crashing and then I would have to start all over! I'd even take back the 1 star,US,2012-12-29 23:01:00,1,Krystal829,Waste of time!!,472014516,
13572,Just plain awful. The search feature is pathetic and doesn't find what you want\, even if you put in an item that you know they have. A total waste of time.,US,2012-12-29 18:03:00,1,susietopspin,Terrible,472014516,
13573,Times out\, crashes\, completely useless. Deleting the app RIGHT NOW before I flip out and throw my iPhone. Thanks Kohl's. ,US,2012-12-29 16:39:00,1,Greg from NJ,Horrible.,472014516,
13574,Hands down the biggest waste of space on a phone.,US,2012-12-29 06:03:00,1,B Radd,Amazing awful,472014516,

13576,I was hoping to download this today and do some online shopping. This app struggled to start and then took ages. I love Kohls. But their app needs a lot of work. I guess it's to the website I go.,US,2012-12-26 16:53:00,1,psligtin,Not a good App,472014516,

13581,What's the point of putting a store app on your phone without access to coupons? Do people actually shop on their phones??,US,2012-12-22 00:35:00,1,Flexiblecreations,What a waste of time!,472014516,
13582,Do the developers of this app even bother reading these reviews? Kohl's has lost me as a customer. Do yourselves a favor and fix this train wreck. Please.,US,2012-12-21 08:39:00,1,EdogawaRiver,What a disaster,472014516,
13583,This app is slow to load and work. It takes significant amount of time to shop through the departments. Navigation would be easy if it didn't take so long to work.,US,2012-12-20 17:40:00,2,Gamergirl1387,Needs lots of work.,472014516,
13584,Whether I manually search ( ie type in) or do the scan\, it always comes up blank. It finds the bar code and description\, because it shows in my history\, but it shows nothing. Poor app\, needs to be fixed.,US,2012-12-19 19:14:00,1,Mdkanderson,Search & scan doesn't work,472014516,
13585,This app never works\, it is just like the Kohls website. I am very disappointed in both and have abandoned my shopping cart numerous times due to the frustrations. Kohls needs to fire their app and website developer because they are not doing their job.,US,2012-12-16 18:38:00,1,KDH56386,Horrible,472014516,
13586,Every time I do a search it shows that x number of items were found but it doesn't let me see them.  Also face the same issue in search thru the app as in the store --- sizes and colors are highly limited. App isn't friendly enough to muddle thru and find sizes or colors that work.,US,2012-12-15 23:51:00,2,Wiggleworm75,Search doesn't work,472014516,
13587,This is honestly by far the worst app ever made!  It has a very slow load time\, the shopping cart disappears when you exit the app\, navigation throughout the app is horrible. Don't waste your time with this\, it's more frustration than its worth!,US,2012-12-14 21:30:00,1,Pukat1,TERRIBLE,472014516,

13590,Doesn't matter how many updates this has - this is one if the absolute worst apps I have ever used... And no\,  not just being over-critical or going off on some irrelevant\, meaningless\, emotional screed. I LOVE kohl's. But this app\, WOW\, you should be ashamed. Seriously. Doesn't have all the content\, and supposedly that should have been helped through the last update. But now\, it's the spinning arrow of death - waiting and waiting and eating and WWAAIITTIINNGG for a page to load. TERRIBLEplease\, please\, PLEASE\, try and make an app that actually works\, cuz now it barely does - AND WAS AWEFUL BEFORE,US,2012-12-13 05:30:00,1,G10¢k$t@r,Takes FFFOOORRREEEVVVEEERRR to load,472014516,
13591,As I was downloading this app\, I read a few reviews. Everyone complained about nearly the same thing\, however\, I never had a problem once. I was searching for a Christmas dress to wear at a party & this app is great for looking at photos & using filters\, etc. I definitely recommend it.,US,2012-12-13 04:41:00,5,Danigrly89,I love it,472014516,
13592,First off\, it's VERY slow. Whenever I try to shop\, it keeps telling me that the request timed out\, then brings me to the previous page. Not impressed.,US,2012-12-12 18:11:00,1,dylank91,No good,472014516,

13594,I used to love this app\, and today I was on it most of the day picking out some gifts for Christmas and had nothing but problems with it. It kept saying 'request timed out' when I was already looking at the item details\, and then bumped me back to the previous page. When I finally got my items into my 'bag' and entered my credit card info it crashed and says 'Security_exception'!! Great! What does this mean?? Is my credit card info now floating out there in limbo waiting for someone to steal it?? And of course the customer service dept is closed at 10pm so I can't get to a human being...I don't know what to do now! Plus I had a special discount that was good today only-hope I get this worked out in the morning. If I knew others were having problems with this app I wouldn't have used it-they should pull it until it works properly.,US,2012-12-11 05:46:00,2,CameraShy868,What happened to this app?,472014516,

13615,Thought it would be quicker to use the app\, not in the slightest bit. Don't waste your time just use safari!,US,2012-11-26 14:02:00,1,Kelsssssea,Not worth the time,472014516,

13619,Inconsistent ability to search for products.  I have 30 items in my cart that I can't delete\, or I do and they reappear.  Scan feature doesn't work...nothing really works.

13622,I have not experienced the crashing that other users seem to be having\, but the shopping cart continuously 'loses' items. I had over 30 items in my cart at one point and when I went back a few hours later\, somehow it was down to 12 items. Annoying. Plus navigating through the app is a pain,US,2012-11-23 14:59:00,2,MamasaurusRex,Needs a lot of work,472014516,

13662,I think you can barely see the merchandise. It's so small. How can I shop like that. Jcpenney recently switched theirs to show big huge pics of their merchandise so you can see it so much better. Take a tip from them\, creators. Don't you think if you created this\, you'd test it out yourself and pretend you are a customer and fix the mistakes and make it great? For a big company like this\, why have they not done this\, yet I am no owner of any store or site or anything yet I know to do that?,US,2012-09-30 10:46:00,2,ODSara,Okay,472014516,

13678,What on earth is wrong with this app?? Downloaded it because kohls mobile website is horrible as well!!  Can't view certain departments (like Shoes/Boots) because the formatting doesn't fit my screen. App is incredibly slow!!  Horrible useless experience.  After 50+ reviews like this and no ones fixing it??,US,2012-09-12 13:50:00,1,Grh12,Formatting all off,472014516,
13679,Well\, it does work. But\, it definitely needs some work. It's slow\, and even some of the formatting on the text fields and input boxes is wrong.

13685,Don't know what you all are talking about. I have an iPhone 4s and this app works great. The only thing I'm disappointed in is when trying to search on the how to for bra sizes\, you have to have the adobe flash player\, and Apple does not support that yet. But this app works great\, you all need to get some patience.,US,2012-08-18 22:54:00,5,cogrc,Great app,472014516,
13686,I wanted to look at the ads and it will pull up but it is so small that you can't read the wording.  Useless app!,US,2012-08-18 04:48:00,2,Lgriff310,Not very helpful!,472014516,

13689,I am unhappy with this app. I think one of the main features of a retail store app would to be able to see sale items and shop easily. This app shows the flier with NO zooming capability. I could do that from my phone online. I deleted it already!,US,2012-08-11 13:41:00,1,Bank mom,Not very good,472014516,

13693,Very poorly executed. In a test of the same product keywords the website returns twice as many hits as the app. The app is a poorly written site aggregator for the kohls website but due to the many bugs it functionality is actually worse then just using their mobile site via safari.They should have invested in writing a real app rather than just trying to redisplay their mobile site.,US,2012-07-14 15:29:00,1,Metsbeliever ,Poorly executed app,472014516,

13700,I had no trouble with this app. It loaded just fine\, did not require a password\, and allows me to look through my local ad. When I went to take a look at the ad\, it did give me an error message\, so I gave it a few seconds to completely load and I was allowed to look through the five different local ads and mailers. Based on the other reviews\, not everyone has been as fortunate\, but I say try for yourself.,US,2012-06-12 17:51:00,5,Itsjustmeoverhere,Works perfectly,472014516,

13705,The app is fine. The pics are small but\, wait for it\, try clicking on them and they enlarge. What a concept. The only thing I would suggest is being able to see if a store has the product in stock.,US,2012-05-24 22:06:00,4,Lady_Mehan,Whiny people,472014516,

13708,This app is less functional than the Kohl's web site\, but adds a VERY annoying feature: it delivers sales messages for things you could buy and it rings with the SMS alert\, which makes me look at my phone expecting a text message. Worse\, the latest incident was a recurring notification about buying gift cards. A new notice came in every 5-10 min. I had to delete the app to get it to stop!  Again\, no value-add and VERY annoying!,US,2012-05-21 17:56:00,1,Blimey27,Annoying!,472014516,
13709,The app keeps sending me push notifications that gift cards are for sale. I've gotten like 5 within the last half hour.,US,2012-05-21 17:53:00,1,Shawn Puckett,Annoying,472014516,
13710,Really Kohls? You have to send me 4 push notifications in 10 minutes about gift cards being available? Really? I had no idea that you could get gift cards at kohls.,US,2012-05-21 17:33:00,2,NarrowNewman,Really?,472014516,
13711,I thought this app would have been better\, but if you're using your iPhone or iPod\, you may as well use Safari because it's nearly the same thing. When I tried to look at swimwear on the app\, it looked like it redirected me to a department menu\, but when I scrolled down there were advertisement pictures in the way of choosing options from the sidebar menu. It could be worse\, but it could also be much better. I suggest optimizing the app for small screens and making it look less like the website. It would be much more functional after those two changes.,US,2012-05-14 06:15:00,2,metallischster,Not made for small screens.,472014516,
13712,I love to shop with iPhone apps\, but not only does this one run slow\, I can't even go to my shopping bag to check out.,US,2012-05-04 12:40:00,1,Muzikguy326,Might just as well delete this app,472014516,
13713,Frustrating\, slow\, links go nowhere or to wrong place. Expected much better from Kohl's! Please fix.,US,2012-04-29 12:49:00,1,Samgirl33,Horrible,472014516,
13714,This app is not easy to use. I tried to look at Juniors bikinis and it would just go back to the main page every time. Has a lot of things they need to fix before I try using it again. Right now it is deleted.,US,2012-04-23 02:26:00,1,Bye bye073593,Not good.,472014516,
13715,Pointless app...,US,2012-04-22 17:36:00,1,Gossetts,No coupons,472014516,
13716,You are better off just getting on their website to shop. App isn't user friendly. And they have a button to check your kohls charge but it transfers you back to their website. I love kohls but hate this app.,US,2012-04-22 17:21:00,1,Ms. Prissy842,Pointless,472014516,
13717,Tried to find a bag\, purse or pocketbook and you have to jump through the same hoops over and over and then get a blank screen this app needs a lot of improvement so it's being deleted.  I will shop by computer it works.,US,2012-04-19 11:15:00,1,Safetydoe,Worst app ever,472014516,
13718,No WiFi and poor data channel  connectivity in stores makes this app  useless.  Detracts from shopping experience big time. Should be pull from the Apple Store until WiFi available in stores.,US,2012-04-17 10:54:00,1,HappyAppler,Store is Great but Not This App,472014516,
13719,Worst app. It's time up an upgrade. Can't shop and it keeps logging me off. By far the worst app! Surprised no one has done anything to fix it,US,2012-04-16 19:49:00,1,Idealshak,Worst app,472014516,
13720,It's not a 'perfect' app but it did what I needed it to. I searched for Angels jeans\, picked two that I liked (on sale!) and purchased them. Too easy.,US,2012-04-16 02:42:00,4,lee721,Just Bought Jeans,472014516,
13721,I love Kohl's. I've been going ever since I got conned into opening a charge. But\, now about the app...  It's good and serves its purpose just fine.  From reading the other reviews I was hesitant to even download but I think the others must be technically challenged.  I found everything and like videos. It's a 4 star because K'e could make better by having a quicklink for sale items and more eye appealing graphics and fonts.,US,2012-04-16 00:45:00,4,KellbombG,Good app!!,472014516,

13723,This has to be one of the worst apps I've ever used. I love the iPad app. Why can't they do as well for iPod?  When I put in a search for women's shoes\, it bring up 7 pairs of Converse sneakers! Com'on.,US,2012-04-14 16:08:00,1,Grammagina,Worst App,472014516,
13724,This app needs tons of work. Very frustrating. Couldn't shop from it. I gave up because it was so frustrating. Lots of animation (maybe animated gifs ??) over the content I was trying to view. :-(,US,2012-04-10 12:43:00,1,Moolyyy,Needs work!,472014516,

13728,The app needs to have its functionalities and links reviewed because so much of the app is broken.,US,2012-03-30 10:45:00,1,Jeff.Cooper,Fix please,472014516,

13732,I work at kohls and have for over a year now. you can't check a stores availability over the Internet even if you could and it said there was 3 of the shirts you wanted that count registers at 7 am two customers could have bought them already and when it says we have 1 DON'T COUNT on it. you won't be the lucky one to find the last one people steal\, stuff gets rung up wrong\, and things get misplaced. customers sure do demand alot for everything we do offer.,US,2012-03-16 23:22:00,5,Ballerj291,Kohls Employee,472014516,
13733,These other reviews are just wrong. Ok it would be nice to have the back button up top BUT IT'S IN THE SAME PLACE AS IT IS IN THE SAFARI BROWSER. So suit complaining this app is great.,US,2012-03-12 18:46:00,5,Killa Magilla,Great,472014516,
13734,It's so Slow and the speical add button is were the back button is supposed to be.,US,2012-03-12 00:54:00,2,Rain Leighton,Couple problems,472014516,
13735,Where is the Facebook integration? It would be nice to see kohl's Facebook and twitter posts within the app. This app doesn't do much but collect your personal information.,US,2012-03-05 19:25:00,1,kh_reviews,Facebook? Twitter?,472014516,
13736,Come on Kohls!  This is HORRIBLE!  Stupid Ad button where the Back button feels like it should be.  I'm shipping at JC Penny instead!  Screw you!,US,2012-03-04 22:58:00,1,Ben Albright,Kohls app-  horrible!,472014516,
13737,App is great. There is a back button to take you to the previous page you were viewing. Very easy!,US,2012-03-01 14:27:00,5,Sns405,Love it!,472014516,
13738,The featured ads link on the top left shaped like a back arrow is the WORST placement ever!  I hate this app.  First time writing a review but I had to take the time to voice my frustration.  It's worse than the stupid clerks at the store who can't look stuff up at other stores.  This app is a time waster.,US,2012-02-27 18:39:00,1,Youdaidit,So annoying!!! Ugh!,472014516,
13739,I really didn't like it when I first got it so I deleted it but one day I had nothing to do and I download it again and played around with it and I really like it. I fell like it really dose protect my passwords and I don't mind logging in. As for the going back and starting over I don't know about your iPhone but mine has going back arrows at the bottom.,US,2012-02-25 21:34:00,5,MademoiselleMarguerite,I really like it,472014516,
13740,I view and pay my bills by phone. If that is what you want to do\, do NOT download this app! The interface does not allow you to do either\, and when you click on the very unobvious text link to your charge account after logging into MY ACCOUNT\, you are sent to a shopping page. Am I missing something here? I guess this site is meant for shopping only. By the way\, I am a web designer by profession.,US,2012-02-25 17:44:00,1,Mark in Tucson,One of the WORST phone apps I have ever used!,472014516,
13741,I would love to be able to check store availability for items through the app. Also\, what appears to be a Back button takes me from an item's description back to a search screen - not to the search results (so I have to re-search for the item and remember which search results I've already looked at). And\, if I add an item to my shopping bag\, then remove it\, next time I load the app\, the item is back in my shopping bag. The only way to truly delete the item from my shopping bag is to delete then reinstall the entire app. I love the store\, but the app is frustrating to me.,US,2012-02-19 18:44:00,2,Groovy Noodles,Needs work,472014516,
13742,Where a back button should be is a link to the 'featured ads'. If you accidentally hit it you pretty much have to completely start over. Not worth the trouble.,US,2012-02-15 14:17:00,2,Steelysioux,Frustrating,472014516,
13743,Most of these people who say this app is bad clearly don't know what they are talking about. This app helps me with my purchases. The head of the app department is a boss. \, enjoy :),US,2012-02-06 16:13:00,5,Haddizzle,Excellent app,472014516,
13744,Flips you to a normal web page that can't be viewed on the iPhone properly. What is the point if it takes you to a page like that - and then you see another download link for the app you thought you were on?  Um\, broken!  Does not work. Will just use the normal web link - this app not working - thx for the try!,US,2012-02-04 14:09:00,1,sunshnez247,Fail.  What was the point?,472014516,
13745,What i would love in this app is if it was able to keep my coupons\, so I could use this app for in-store purchases. That's what I want!!,US,2012-02-02 02:57:00,3,mjharmon,Would be great if...,472014516,
13746,I didn't even get past the terms and conditions. Kohl's\, you have no business using your app to collect my personal information.,US,2012-01-29 18:52:00,1,Corps2332,Dissapointed,472014516,
13747,The interface is terrible. Entering keywords in the search area do not work. Thank goodness it was free. All you have to do is delete it. 10 minutes of my life I'll never get back though.,US,2012-01-28 15:52:00,1,CorpVid1987,Horrible App,472014516,

13749,Horrible! TOS are ridiculous. The interface stinks. It takes you to the mobile version of their website\, which isn't even scaled for mobile usage. No online shopping. The web feature to link to a Kohl's credit account stinks at best. I could go on\, but why bother. It took me longer to type this review than it did to create this app. 0 stars. Fail. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!,US,2012-01-22 06:13:00,1,Pat 79,Sad excuse for an app,472014516,

13753,Need to scrap the app and start again from the ground up. Hard to navigate\, keeps jumping around\, crashes!! Also\, you need to build in the ability to pay your Kohl's charge from the app.,US,2012-01-12 21:26:00,1,princessmariia13,Bad,472014516,
13754,This app is worthless. Keeps jumping around\, images are half off the screen. I can't find what I'm looking for. Soon as I find something close the screen changes on me.,US,2012-01-12 15:51:00,2,Rhonda Jacoby,Wothless,472014516,
13755,In reading this app’s privacy policy… it would seem… that policy (which you must agree to) is designed to ABUSE your privacy.,US,2012-01-10 22:48:00,1,Arch Rival,No way!,472014516,
13756,This app doesn't work... I can't see what I'm looking for and it's SLOW!!! deleting it now.,US,2012-01-05 01:01:00,1,Hurricanemily,Like the store. Hate the app.,472014516,
13757,It's getting a bad rap but I think it's a great app! Clear product info\, multiple photos\, and seems to be current on in-stock inventory counts (greying out the sizes they don't have in stock). Store finder worked fine\, haven't tried the scanner but browsing was good - and the current ad came right up! Love Kohls! :),US,2011-12-25 11:24:00,5,Angie222,Great App,472014516,
13758,Avoid this app.  There TOS is crazy. I don't understand why a company that has such a lenient return policy feels to have a TOS that would make a Gov lawyer proud.,US,2011-12-22 13:57:00,1,BoardHead,Scary TOS!!!,472014516,
13759,I open this app to get a disclaimer screen that basically says we're gonna take any and all information from you\, including about the device you use to access this\, and give it to whoever we want\, and what they do with it isn't our problem. Are you kidding me? I deleted it before it even opened. I wanted to give it 0 stars!!,US,2011-12-21 01:36:00,1,Ggggggg43434,WHAT!?,472014516,
13760,Went to a Kohl's store yesterday and when they were out of a particular item\, I downloaded this app to help order it online. Only problem is the barcode didn't pull up the item. Or ANY item for that matter. I scanned a dozen or so items in the store and not a single one was recognized. Go to the web\, and search the item thru Google and guess which store pops up first?  That's right\, Kohls.com. Obviously\, I'm deleting this app.,US,2011-12-20 06:27:00,1,Chris Elliott,Won't recognize anything,472014516,
13761,This Apps UI has the basic layout constructed.  But there is choppiness when selecting a clickable item.  The borders and margins are off the screen\, displaying only have the image.  It's evident that this is just trying to reference mobile kohls.com.  Needs some more QA before going to production.  In need of more usability testing.Please contact me if you would like specific user experience feedback.  I love kohls and would love to see this utility be successful.  (And I'd really love to use it...),US,2011-12-19 00:36:00,1,DJ.Padilla,A good start\, but poor follow through,472014516,
13762,The app works well for me. I love being able to go to the site from the app. It was useless before. Now it has real functions. Not sure of the complaints\, I have used it several times.,US,2011-12-15 16:59:00,4,crasshipster,Greatly improved.,472014516,

13766,Downloaded the app and I found it difficult to use. It displayed the add ok but if you wanted to know info on the add it was next to impossible. If you clicked on the picture it would give you a long list of products you had to sort thru. I ended up deleting this app. Not worth using.,US,2011-12-07 19:16:00,1,Redrob49,Difficult to use,472014516,

13768,Hey Kohl's - get a clue! There have been times when I've chosen not to charge an in-store purchase to my Kohl's card because your site is so difficult to use on an iphone (especially to make payments).  I was hoping this app would at least have that functionality\, but apparently you guys don't like getting paid.  Get with the program already.,US,2011-12-04 22:39:00,1,chicacole,Needs more features,472014516,

24218,Until today\, this was the best catalog I had for researching future purchases on the go or at an event. Today I decided to make a purchase thru the app and was very impressed with the layout and ease of use when placing an order. Love this app even more now.,US,2014-12-30 01:48:00,5,Johnny B. ,Not just for browsing,390928219,
24219,Love B&H's app. It's very helpful when researching items for future purchase. I buy online but not thru the app. Rely on it on a regular basis.,US,2014-12-30 00:39:00,5,Johnmb1,Excellent app,390928219,
24220,The app is fine\, I like it a lot. The ordering experience though has some issues. Not with service\, but with the app vs online ordering. Purchased a laptop\, great price however online the shipping prices for expedited - 2nd day or next day are much higher than most modern ecommerce sites today. Honestly if Amazon had it in stock I would have ordered it from them because it's cheaper to ship - item itself was the same price. Plus when I tried ordering the same item with the app the rates and choices for shipping were different than I had online. Instead of $34 for 2nd day\, on the app I had the choice of next day Fedex for $19. Interesting. Overall I like the company\, service\, etc.\, but the differences in online vs app ordering is strange and the shipping rates are high at least online. Fine place to order from if you aren't in a hurry. In summary I give the experience overall a 3 - average rating. Fix these problems and it's easily 5 stars.,US,2014-12-29 21:36:00,3,Ihop23947,Great app\, shipping rates stink.,390928219,

24223,Nice app. Only gave it 4 stars because I've only used the app so far to browse through their products. Easy to navigate around. I haven't actually used it to checkout any items though.,US,2014-12-28 06:29:00,4,Ogeezy8,Great App,390928219,
24224,The App parallels the web site very well but I must admit that I have only used the App for browsing and adding to my wish list.  I haven't completed a cart and checkout other than on the full site.  One thing that I would like to see is the ability to select products for a side by side comparison but I can understand that owing to the shear magnitude of the inventory I should be happy with applying filters to arrive at final selection.  I'm fairly new to B&H but if all remains the same I'll be with them for life. Best regards\, Bruce Wittig,US,2014-12-28 06:13:00,5,N1EBQ,B&H Photo,390928219,

24249,I've made several attempts to purchase camera equipment\, going through the entire process only to be met with complete frustration when completing my order. I have had several instances where I'm told my address does not match my credit card number. Only after repeatedly selecting the same address does it eventually move to the next step. At the end of the process\, it repeatedly informs me that I failed to select a shipping method even though the final checklist SHOWS the one I selected. After repeatedly selecting it again over and over\, I get the same 'error'. Really\, who needs this level of frustration when trying to make a purchase?

24313,Hey B&H\,It'd be an amazing thing\, for the app to stay on the page it's on...when I briefly exit the app\, then come back to it later it takes me back to the Home Page...it would be nice to continue to look at what I was looking at a few minutes ago without navigating throughout the app again. Thank You.Lou Diamond,US,2014-11-09 20:39:00,3,eLDiOh,1 Thing to bump to 5 stars...,390928219,
24314,Very we'll made,US,2014-11-09 19:27:00,5,Clarifan,Great app!,390928219,

24316,Good animations\, works perfectly,US,2014-11-08 11:28:00,5,StevenAdrianus,Nice app,390928219,
24317,Love everything about this app! The only thing I've had a problem with is creating a wish list. It just keeps saying there's an error. But other than that\, everything is perfect!,US,2014-11-07 18:00:00,5,13alex95,Great app,390928219,

24319,Great app!,US,2014-11-06 00:14:00,5,IamSlonik,S,390928219,
24320,Thanks for the update B&H!!,US,2014-11-05 19:54:00,4,Wenscool,Awesome update!!,390928219,
24321,Leave it to B&H to be at the forefront of mobile shopping apps. It's amazing how simple and informative their app is; yet big companies like Amazon are still trailing behind. The integration of TouchID and it's quick optimization for the iPhone 6/6 Plus shows B&H is setting the bar on what kind of experience online shopping should be for the consumer. You guys are awesome and your prices just rock. It's always a pleasure buying items from them. I have moved away from buying electronics at Amazon. B&H is my first and only stop now. No tax and free expedited shipping are only a couple of the numerous perks shopping with them. I just wish they would start carrying Bluray movies so I could dump Amazon altogether. Keep up the excellent work guys and look forward to a lot more purchases from this loyal customer.,US,2014-11-05 16:32:00,5,sharpie000,I'd give it 10 stars if I could,390928219,
24322,I haven't purchased anything with it yet\, but it works very nicely on my iPhone 5s. Nice and fast\, great interface\, really helps when I'm planning out studio purchases.,US,2014-11-05 15:19:00,5,Will Eifler,Great app for browsing products,390928219,
24323,This app just keeps getting better and better all the time. In fact\, so far this is the only app that I have out of 500 apps on my iPhone that actually have begun using Safari Keychain to auto fill my password. I have been waiting for this to be implemented in ever since I heard that it was going to be a feature in iOS 8 and B&H is the only app that I know that does this. Oh\, and let's also not forget that B&H even embraced Touch ID and iPhone 6 and 6 Plus resolution support way early on too.I really couldn't ask for a better retail app than B&H. Keep up the great work!,US,2014-11-05 12:14:00,5,IcarasX,One of the best\, most updated apps on the App Store,390928219,
24324,Every time I switch to a different app\, it sends me back to the start page when I return so I lose track of where I was.,US,2014-11-04 23:42:00,3,Karl-Franz,Needs improvement,390928219,
24325,I love this app a lot\, but the latest update crashes when you go back to it after leaving it for a minute. I hope this can be fixed. Crashes on 4th gen ipad.,US,2014-11-04 18:29:00,4,Udyxyybibivyrcyvubunuvcxr,Great app\, but this version keeps crashing,390928219,
24326,Great app. Just a minor bug. After opening app and returning to IPhone home screen and re entering BHPhoto app\, app crashes and closes.,US,2014-11-04 02:02:00,5,danreds,Awesome cart animation,390928219,
24327,This is by far the best shopping app I have used. I struggled with it at first\, but now everything from searching\, researching\, to checking out is so well designed that the process is actually fun (even as I watch my money float away). The checkout process requires little more than a few swipes and there is some really neat animation throughout the app to add a little flavor. This app doesn't really need a review since it's free and for a specific company\, but I must say bravo to B&H for a killer app. I prefer to use this over your site.,US,2014-11-03 20:34:00,5,Pat Thompson,One of the best!,390928219,
24328,Great app that looks terrible on the newest flagship iPhones.Update: I just got a spam marketing push notification. Misuse of notifications and not allowed in App Store apps. Taking away all stars for that.,US,2014-11-03 17:12:00,1,67a5sdf687ss08as,Not optimized for iPhone 6 Plus,390928219,
24329,It's not quite a five\, but ...I found it a little tricky and not entirely 'intuitive to the casual observer' but once I got that down I can get what I want. The layout is good and\, so far ordering has been a breeze. I really like it. This should be a 'do' in how to build a B2C app.,US,2014-11-03 05:39:00,5,dmpyron,4 1/2 stars,390928219,
24330,This stores prices and products are incredible. Finding products with app is good. Checking out is horrible. Swiping up to find hidden menus. It's like playing a video game to pay for a product. The last version check out was simple and less frustrating to learn.,US,2014-11-03 01:50:00,2,cb60089,Bring last version back,390928219,

24332,Clean\, easy to use... makes shopping and buying a breeze.,US,2014-11-02 04:39:00,5,Chuckimos,Grade A,390928219,
24333,App is has good presentation of products.  Nice features but shopping cart in previous version was straightforward layout on white background. Was easy to see\, but now I guess someone thought it would look cool in a less straightforward layout on a blurred background of the app.  Makes it hard to see items in the cart\, their prices and your total.  Swipe to order makes it easy to order by mistake.,US,2014-10-31 12:28:00,3,Marshgar,nice app but hard to see shopping cart,390928219,
24334,Find what I need quickly and checkout is simple. Of course there is a huge selection of products!,US,2014-10-29 22:25:00,5,slave23d,Great,390928219,

24336,Seemed like a well designed app until I tried to delete something from my shopping cart. Now I can't use the app unless I buy the unwanted items•!,US,2014-10-29 00:59:00,1,Lark28408,Have a Problem,390928219,
24337,when it comes to the checkout process\, the app does not follow thru. There seems to be a glitchWhen it comes to choosing the shipping address\, 'an unexpected error has ocurred' comes up persistently\, even when adding or editing an address.,US,2014-10-28 14:56:00,1,2fortwo,Great forShopping but....,390928219,

24343,As a photographer I log onto the B&H website VERY often to price & research my future purchases. This app truly makes my life easier\, being mobile and having B&H at my fingertips is a joy.

24349,In the update description it notes support for iPhone 6 and 6+ but the app still scales. False. Also\, where is the Apple Pay? This is an app for an Apple device and I have zero intention of ever using Google wallet.,US,2014-10-20 18:33:00,1,Rey G,No iPhone 6/6+ support or Apple Pay,390928219,

24355,Unfortunately it's not actually optimized for iPhone 6 yet\, despite their claims of it being iOS 8 and iPhone 6 'ready'. Lots of apps are ready\, but they're not necessarily optimized.,US,2014-10-19 19:48:00,3,sumowondertoad,Not ready for iPhone 6...,390928219,

24361,The app deserves 5 stars. I've been working in corporate UX for a few short years and have never played with a content-rich app with such notable UI and robustness.I imagine - like many going to B&H - that people want to sift through information and specs efficiently to compare hardware and reviews before making a purchase. One iOS-baked feature I was expecting to be here - but isn't - is the ability to jump to the top of a scrolling page by tapping the status bar clock. For whatever reason it was removed from this app but exists in almost all apps. It makes flipping through and double-checking information so easy. Especially on those spec sheets with longer scrolls.,US,2014-10-14 13:51:00,4,Satchell Drakes,Noteworthy Experience; 1 Thing,390928219,

24363,This is an app I truly love to use. That they actually thought about flow and user experience makes searching for and purchasing the exact equipment I need a joy. I can't say that about too many apps from retailers\, who sometimes quite frankly just seem to slap one out and call it done. Quality design and execution matters and this app has it!,US,2014-10-13 00:48:00,5,Ray Harrison,Absolute 5,390928219,
24364,Best app out there for shopping electronic devices of all sorts!!,US,2014-10-12 06:41:00,5,Mordchai,Great App!,390928219,
24365,I've shopped at B&H since the mid-90s when we were still printing from film to paper. Their prices have always been great but usually at the expense of a good shopper's experience (unless you went to the store in NYC). Their app\, however\, makes shopping fun and easy. Unlike other shopping apps\, it's very simple to find exactly what you're looking for\, and the UI is smooth and quick. It's one of the few stores which I've intentionally subscribed to their newsletter!,US,2014-10-11 16:10:00,5,BenDayDot,Great app design,390928219,
24366,The app reflects the professionalism and commitment of the staff at B and H photo to equip their customers with not only the gear\, but the skills and understanding to succeed at their craft.

24372,Great app\, love it. Allows me to view B&H's extensive inventory and place orders. Great company\, great service.But\, I fear this app is going to cause my wife to divorce me.

24409,Firstly\, B&H policy\, customer service\, knowledge base\, and overall vibe is by far the best when we are comparing it to other electronics retailers. I've purchased a number of toys from B&H and they have never ever been late on their delivery date\, nothing on their site is misleading\, and if I did have a question\, all the questions were answered or resolved in a satisfactory fashion.Aside from being the most liked electronics dealer. This app also goes to show what I've mentioned above\, the app is offered so properly that I can't seem to find anything wrong with it. All your information\, purchase history\, direct tracking number as well as real-time tracking info.\, everything that should be on a app like this is there\, and it's presented in a 'no-fuss' easy to view UI. My only gripe is that I wish a B&H store was here in California. Bravo B&H\, I give you permission to dig through my wallet. Other electronics retailers\, take note--this is how you run an online retail store.,US,2014-09-10 20:25:00,5,Dinka6288,The app that deserves a 5,390928219,

24411,I've used B&H for 20+ years and they are one of the very best online merchants. Period. As someone who rarely writes reviews\, I'm doing this one 20 minutes after getting the app and about 5 minutes after placing an order. I was that impressed. This app worked flawlessly and made my initial sign in\, shopping and checkout process intuitive and seamless and fast. This is a sterling example of how to design a world class mobile app for online commerce.,US,2014-09-09 23:39:00,5,apbtlvr1,Outstanding,390928219,

24428,B&H is by far America's best electronic store. And even though I'm 3000 miles away from the store\, this app makes me feel as if I were closer than the nearest consumer electronics store.  Along with this app\, B&H's expertise\, service\, selection\, price and shipping care cannot be beat.The only thing I would ask of this convenient app is that they make the tracking number on shipping orders hyperlinked\,  or at least selectable\, to be copied from.,US,2014-08-25 21:45:00,4,dataBANG,Kosher Convenience!,390928219,

24439,Much faster than trying to browse on safari when on 3g... Love all the features. The only thing I didn't like was that I couldn't find the 'modify/cancel' order button like on the mobile site. Maybe its there but I didn't see it. I wish it had that or even better\, two separate buttons for modify order and cancel.  I also wish that when viewing your order in the order history\, that the items on the order were clickable so you can see the product page of what you ordered.

24448,It's clear that B&H has some good developers for this app\, but it seems to take all the wrong lessons from movement and motion from other UXs. In the sidebar\, there are long fly-ins where I just want to click on a category. Things appear to layer in ways that don't add continuity to the design. The UI is a strange hodgepodge of controls\, making it unintuitive. It's clear that B&H cares about this app and keeping it current\, but there's a lot that could be done to help me buy things faster.,US,2014-08-04 02:14:00,3,_MCB,Too Much Motion,390928219,

24451,I really love this app. It is well organized and makes it a breeze to find what you want. There are a few things I would like to see added to the site that would improve on it... There is no phone number on the app if you wish to call them quickly to get additional information - you have to bump out to a web browser to find that information. It would also be nice to print a receipt once you have purchased an item. Other than that I gave it 4 stars as there is always room for improvement!,US,2014-07-30 20:23:00,4,Wood Jonesin',Almost stellar app...,390928219,

24453,I almost never review apps but I must say this app must be one of the top iPhone/iPad applications I've ever used. This app leaves me no reason to use an actually desktop site in order to do what I have to do. It's a shame major corporations can't create great mobile apps for their customers but B&H Photo can pull it off!,US,2014-07-29 03:58:00,5,jneto08,10/10,390928219,
24454,I've been shopping with B&H for years and this app is a great\, natural extension to their online catalog. I find it very easy to use and navigate although the sliding panels were a bit of an adjustment from the typical website.

I've found it simple due to the fact that it has easy objects to tap on.  Very cool that it notifies store status and hours on app.Minus star because I want to see external reviews listed.  It's hard to incorporate that but doable.  It would make the app flawless.  Otherwise\, people have to use this site more for review rather than purchase.

24489,UPDATE: All the issues listed below have since been fixed (quickly\, too). This is now a really efficient app\, thanks! ---------------------Don't get me wrong\, whoever designed the aesthetic aspects of this app got it right. It's useful and smooth and makes browsing friendlier . However\, the actual coding is not. This app is loaded with glitches and bugs galore. When I try and open pictures of a product\, it crashes. Now\, when I open my CART\,  it crashes. It's prone to doing this. And sometimes when it crashes\, my iPod automatically reboots. It looks great\, but looks aren't everything. P.S.: the option to view B&H's video reviews as well would be a plus.,US,2014-06-27 04:04:00,5,hazoko2,Problems fixed!,390928219,

24835,It's a great app for sure. Only small issue I had was this. Let say your are buying a Canon all in one printer\, which I did. It would be great if all the accessories for that device were directly connected to that devise. So you buy the printer\, you need ink\, you shouldn't have to go and look for it. Put it right there for the customer. You need paper\, put the paper right there for the customer. I love the app\, great interface. Just need that small tweet.

24852,This is a really great app\, I use it all the time\, I really think it's a grand idea\, and it's very useful.There are just a few things I wish they would fix.In the last version\, you were able to reorganize your wish list by priority so that if you were having a public wish list as an example\, people would know which gifts were more important to you than others. But that feature has been taken out of the new version\, I'd like it to be brought back so that when I hit edit I can move the important product to the top.The other thing I wish is that the wish list itself were accessible from an area that didn't take three or four steps to get to. I'm glad it's still there\, but I'd like it to be part of the normal functioning area rather than having to go into my account and then find my wish list\, it should be part of the function of the shopping cart rather than a separate area altogether.,US,2013-12-11 18:39:00,4,Stone804,Really great app!

24860,Yes\, the app is attractive. Browsing is excellent. Organization and search is excellent. The app is truly a pleasure to use for wading through their vast product catalog. However\, when it comes time to buy (using a gift card)\, it was appallingly bad. Leaving a half finished order and returning requires you to renter all kinds of payment information\, shipping\, etc despises hitting Save. It froze when choosing a shipping method\, had to force a close and restart\, and enter my info alllll over yet again. Putting in the gift card amount appeared to work\, but when hitting Save and returning to order\, the amount didn't show. It looked as though the whole order would be charged to my credit card\, not just the balance after debit for the gift card amount. No way to verify. No way to get it to total correctly. Extremely frustrating and unprofessional.,US,2013-12-09 00:46:00,1,Avid puzzler,Pretty\, until you try to buy,390928219,

24925,This was a top rates app. Then after updates it started acting up. Select review and it bounced me out of the app to my wallpaper. Wish list worked iffy.

25009,Like the rest of us\, I have been using B&Hs website for years to review and purchase photo equipment. The mobile website is a nice\, simplified version but seems to make navigation a little more restrictive. This app helps not only make navigation through departments easier\, but adds the advantages of staying logged in and user specific extras such as a specific wish list\, product notifications\, and account info.My only gripe is that the filter sections seem to load slower than when using my mobile browser. But in the end\, at only 10Mb\, the app is well worth it!!!,US,2013-10-01 00:05:00,5,Superpropilotguy,More useful version of the mobile website,390928219,

25198,Please pay no attention to people that write reviews saying this app does not work. They are the same people that need a class on how to operate their iPhone and get stuck on what the large button on the bottom does. B&H is a class act with a first class app. I have ordered plenty of equipment using this app\, sometimes from a client's office. I have searched for items\, managed wish lists\, and read customer reviews (hopefully accurate ones) with this app since I discovered it months ago. This app gets five stars without any hesitation. You do not even need to be technically inclined to use this app effectively. However\, you should at least know what the large button on the bottom of your iPhone does.,US,2013-04-30 21:52:00,5,TSouppa,Who says this app does not work?,390928219,

25960,I and a photography enthusiast and I order all of my gear from B&H. This app allows me to brows B&H's vast product catalog and make purchases along the way\, it allows me to manage my wish lists\, as well as giving me something to do in-between classes at school! I use this app more than any others. If you are a photographer and you need to make purchases on the go\, or just like to browse threw gear\, this is the way to go. ( if you are not familiar with B&H they have everything from the cheapest products\, to insanely expensive products ),US,2012-12-19 16:50:00,5,Todd Christopher,My favorite app,390928219,

25965,The app is excellent for browsing the vast inventory at B&HPHOTO. The problem is that the app never remembers login credentials- it's required to continually re-enter the password. I have also encountered significant errors with the wishlist (php error messages) and the app crashes often. Definitely a work in progress- please optimize ASAP.,US,2012-12-08 15:53:00,3,Frequent flyer app reviewer,Needs work,390928219,
25966,I use an iPod Touch (4th gen.) with this app. I have found no faults with this app and I am very impressed with the quality\, ease-of-use\, and professionalism of the B&H app.,US,2012-12-05 19:32:00,5,Prince Rivvy,Professional,390928219,
25967,I love the app\, but now it is taking up 171MB of space (and growing)\, and I cannot find a way to remove this data that came from downloaded pictures of products and other related info. There should be an option in settings.,US,2012-11-18 01:37:00,4,Patreba,Can't delete user data,390928219,

25971,This is a wonderful App. I've found it easy to navigate. I've had none of the problems other reviewers have mentioned. Everything loads quickly and I find it easy to search for what I'm looking for. I love the website\, this has just made it easier to navigate on my IPhone. 2 thumbs up!!!!,US,2012-07-26 13:19:00,5,Opus Maximus,Fantastic!!!!,390928219,
25972,Even if it's free\, I feel myself not wanting to even buy anything on this app just cause it takes so long. My wish list always disappears( I guess that's magical lol) but the images take forever to load and I can't maneuver the app that well in the first place. This definitely needs to be taken back to the code writers and designers to make it easier for the consumer to buy things they want easily. I actually think B&H's sales would increase if they would take a little bit more time working on the quality of this app. Great idea\, very poor design,US,2012-07-09 04:44:00,2,Scotty Marcelo,Not worth it,390928219,
25973,My searches were fast and easy.  It did not take a long time for images to load as some have said; maybe they just long for the simpler times before Smartphones - they probably miss coating those wet plates too.,US,2012-07-04 16:05:00,5,Grimpnypoink,Great for browsing gear quickly,390928219,
25974,I love B&H\, but this app is unusable. I can navigate the website in Safari faster than the app.,US,2012-05-29 05:31:00,1,grunyen,Slooooooooooooow,390928219,
25975,The app launches just fine\, but it takes forever to get results from searches\, categories\, or filtering. So long\, in fact\, that my screen turns off while waiting -- multiple times. Since one needs to find products in order to buy them\, this bug renders the app useless. I hope this will be fixed soon.,US,2012-05-24 18:02:00,1,teofilrocks,Sloooooow,390928219,
25976,Not near as functional as the website. In fact it's very cumbersome and not functional for buying more than 1 item.  Moving between cart and wish lists is limited if not impossible. I've shopped BH for years online and it's awesome. This app is not. Plus it's iPhone only and looks ugly. This app does not live up to the Brand of BH Photo. Also it's time consuming figuring out it's designers navigation.,US,2012-05-23 22:24:00,2,stevengotts,Use the website,390928219,
25977,This is convenient. Woould like access to Event Space and 'My Event Space'. Include access to B&H free educational videos from the website. Where is the iPad version?,US,2012-05-01 15:29:00,3,Baram Raleinie,Decent,390928219,

25980,I love the simplicity of this app\, when it works.  These days on my iPhone 4\, the wish list simply won't work.  I get errors every time I try to add something to the list.  And the last time I checked out\, the button to choose my shipping speed simply never responded\, making the checkout impossible.  I had to use my iPhone browser to checkout on the main site - big headache.  This isn't a new problem\, so please give it some attention.  Thanks!,US,2012-02-15 02:32:00,3,Land Ho FIlms,Great app\, but buggy,390928219,
25981,This app is very glitchy. Every time I add an item to my cart it adds but ifI try to delete an item it will disappear for 1 second them reappear. I tried to delete the app and reinstall it but after 5 minutes the same thing happens. Need to update this app and fix the problems. I know it's not my phone because it also happens on my wife phone.,US,2012-02-09 19:58:00,1,Capture the moment on a photo,Very glitchy and bad bugs,390928219,

25984,As seems to be a sad reality with B&H as of late\, they have lost the excellent attention to detail and wonderful customer service that made them one of the largest names in professional photo and video supply.  Take this app\, for example.  I am writing this review in November\, 2011...the last time this app was updated was nearly 8 (yes\, EIGHT) months ago!!  A lot can (and does) change in 8 months.  iOS 5 for example.Come on guys\, you really need to get your act together and get back to the innovation\, low pricing\, knowledgable staff\, etc. that made you great.  Me personally\, well\, I have all but completely switched to ADORAMA!!  At least they haven't gotten so large that they lose sight of who they are.  I hope B&H will take this review to heart and get an iPad version and update their app!,US,2011-11-08 07:02:00,2,Rckt-Scientist,Did B&H forget about their own app???,390928219,

25988,I love B&H they have the lowest prices in the country and their app is great too!  But just recently it's been crashing when it tries to load a lot of items on a page.  It was fine before and I reset my iPod and reinstalled the app to see if it would fix it but no dice.  Look into the stability issues and fix it in the next update and you won't have to ask me twice to change it to five stars.,US,2011-06-06 03:08:00,3,Mark Adkins,Good app but recent stability issues...,390928219,

However\, as I searched the site I noticed\, as others have mentioned\, no Wishlist or ability to search the Used Store (my favorite section). I am currently shopping for a new camera and the moment I tapped the 'Reviews' button\, the app crashed. I reopened the app\, went back to the same spot and bam!...Crashed again!

26014,If I try to view any item that is in a particular search\, only the header info comes up. I cannot view any of the item details\, as it says 'loading' for a while\, followed by 'connection timed out.' The only workaround is to email myself a link from within the app\, then open the link in a safari window.,US,2011-01-17 16:42:00,1,G. Quagmire,Can't view item details,390928219,

26017,Add wish list and it's a 5 star. Easier to navigate than actual web site. Best organized and search of any app out there.

26018,I am very impressed with B&H and this app makes their products even more accessible than their web interface. Because it's a phone app it doesn't swamp you with too much info all at once\, yet you can still get the details that you are interested in (progressive disclosure).  Rock solid so usable that I just bought a camera with it. Sweet.,US,2010-12-28 21:42:00,5,Jason in Florida,Even better than their web interface!,390928219,

26020,This is a very useful app. It let's me browse through B&H website and order equipments right from my iPhone. Would love to see the following things in the next update:1) wishlist2) a better in-app order history interface. right now it just loads web version which is hard to see,US,2010-12-03 03:44:00,5,odyseuss,Very useful app,390928219,

26033,This is an app I have been waiting a long time got. I can search the entire store with ease. Can purchase right from the app\, but I have no access to my wish list. This lack of an option was not very well thought out in my opinion before being released.  Any registered person should have access to their wish list. If I am on the go\, I still have to visit the website to confirm what was placed in the wish list. Please update this app to include the wish list function. Pleased overall with the app except for this one flaw mentioned.,US,2010-10-19 18:38:00,3,Derrickb1974,Great app and pleased overall\, but....,390928219,
26034,Its a great app...You guys just always seem to come out with a bang. Not a half baked app. Anything that you can think of is there.

26042,Needs the ability to review and add to your wish list. Since I already have a wish list\, I still have to go to the regular website\, so this isn't as useful as it could be. Also reviewing your purchase history takes you to the website. It would be nice to have that optimized for the phone. Otherwise\, I'd give it 5 stars.,US,2010-10-15 13:45:00,3,blu3phoenix,Needs wish list,390928219,

26054,B&H Photo is the one of the oldest\, most respected camera stores in the country.  Their customer service is second to no other company\, in any industry.  Every photographer I know would not buy gear from any place else.,US,2010-10-15 02:43:00,5,RB2 GOLF,Tradition of Excellence,390928219,

I deleted the app\, reset my phone and reinstalled the app with no luck.  I can browse but not being able to log in to purchase makes the app useless.Update: B&H app support contacted me today to ask about a special character in my online password. I changed/updated my password and the app finally works.

26061,This app is a great way to browse the tremendous selection B&H has to offer. It would be nice to have access to wish lists\, add to\, remove from them\, etc.   It also would be great if the app remembered CC info for simplified ordering. Add those two features and the App gets 5 stars!,US,2010-10-12 17:57:00,4,deejayqueue,Great App from a great store,390928219,

26068,Simple but thorough and enjoyable (if you like browsing photographic products). It almost doesn't matter how good the app is\, it matters that there is one for the best store in the world.In future it would be nice to see info and registration for the Event Space.

39971,This is an excellent medical app that allows physicians to communicate quickly efficiently and most productively in a HIPAA compliant manner.We began using Doximity approximately three years ago and now the majority of our ACO physicians use it to communicate quickly about patient care and care coordination.The ability to send a colleague or case manager clinical nurse a face-sheet or list of meds or other clinical data to improve coordination of care has been outstanding!!!John Venetos MDChairman of Independent Physician ACO of Chicago,US,2014-12-21 14:22:00,5,John Venetos MD,Doximity review,393642611,
39972,This is a best-kept secret for physician only apps in the US. Registration is simple & easy. The app pulls out publicly available data on US-based physicians and displays them in an intuitive way. With this app\, it's very easy to find office phone number fax and contact details of physicians - very useful when you are referring patients. In a HIPAA compliant platform\, you can consult colleagues & specialists. You can have social media features of Facebook\, LinkedIn etc. all in one in a closed community of verified US based physicians. You can keep yourself up-to-date with the latest medical news\, your specialty news and research articles and have a discussion of them with your colleagues in irounds.,US,2014-11-22 15:22:00,5,dnes-ton,Great App for US based physicians,393642611,
39973,I am a primary care doc. I heard about doximity and signed up and downloaded the app. Wow\, I found so much excitement about the service! All my friends from med school - lost track as well as current peers. What I found through I barely ever used the service again. What would make it really stick is ability to take beyond social into the medical workflows. Such a great design getting wasted.. I get it - the intention is to limit exposure to PHI… But medical data is all I care about and this is supposed to be a great app for doctors? By the way - everything I missed in Doximity I found in health gorilla app. I think if Doximity went more towards the clinical data in my practice/faxes/referrals/lab results and exchange - that would be awesome!,US,2014-11-15 00:02:00,3,SY_23,Great app\, but what’s the use beyond initial excitement?,393642611,

I Googled my name two days after I signed up\, and one of the top two hits is doximity\, and there it is\, my entire credentials plus my home address! Thanks a lot doximity. Now any unstable patient that I see can come visit me at home! I wrote to doximity\, could not find any way to call or contact them\, and told them to remove my address\, and this is not been done yet.

39980,1- keeps trying to get me to add 'colleagues' I've never known. Probably to boost numbers\, to be able to lure advertisers. 2- news not specific to my specialties 3- groups not specific to any specialties\, and threads aren't even grouped together\, making it even more difficult to navigate. Not useful at all. I'll probably delete the app until they've had more time to Fix this issue. Other medicine related news and group sites are way ahead of this. I almost didn't even give this one star.,US,2014-10-02 14:37:00,1,spyder123,Too difficult to navigate. Non-specific. Too long to load!,393642611,

39982,I get frustrated when I open an email regarding interesting articles on the doximity site.  When I click the link\, it doesn't bring me to the article and I then can't find the article. Doximity\, in my opinion\, doesn't really keep me connected to other docs. I find it easier just to pick up the phone and call them.,US,2014-08-31 13:30:00,2,Burpygirl,Ho hum,393642611,

39986,Still work in a practice environment that can't seem to let go of the fax?  Me too.  Ever wish you could send and receive faxes without getting toner on your hands?  Meet Doximity...one can send and receive HIPAA compliant faxes from your laptop...or tablet...or smartphone.  And no more waiting by the fax machine for the transmittal page to know if your fax was successful or not--you can receive an alert to your smartphone\, notifying you of success or failure.And the personal fax number is just one of many features of this useful app.  CME\, social networking with other physicians\, online CV...it will likely become one of your most useful medical apps.,US,2014-07-15 04:32:00,5,Jim O'Callaghan,Fax-tastic!,393642611,

39991,The app would be useful if the staff behind the app wasn't SO disorganized. I've sent in my ID and other information 3 times now\, but they still haven't 'verified' me\, so I can't add 'colleagues'... It's very frustrating\, so I deleted it.

39994,I liked the articles doximity sent\, but then received 'your access has been revoked\,' and I have NO IDEA why! I have no malpractice issues. Nothing! I have not written to doximity complaining. I have just read the articles they send. So---why did they 'revoke'' my access?!?!?! I could see if they said\, 'you need to sign in again' but nooooo\, that's not it. So I don't know what the problem is\, and can't get hold of support\, because my access is revoked!,US,2014-05-17 12:41:00,1,charesepel,'Your access has been revoked',393642611,
39995,Great idea--just not there yet.  Rolladex is excellent and seems up to date.  Unfortunately not all names show up on ipod list even after adding them as colleagues.  They do show up on laptop so it is strange. Sent several messages to support.  They were cordial but it is still broken.  Also\, shared info with a few docs and that wasn't recognized by app either.  Not that many docs use this of my colleagues so it falls short there.  Last\, the name searches are slow and the name has to be spelled perfect or it won't show up.Overall I like it.  I think others will too once it catches on.  The bugs can be fixed.  Maybe they are in the latest update\, but my equipment is old and for now this is the latest update I can get.,US,2014-05-14 20:33:00,3,M1tch3ll123,Good but could be better,393642611,

40002,If you miss the camaraderie\, stimulation and friendly\, informal consults you used to enjoy\, Doximity is for you.

40003,As of the past week (first week of April) there is a new bug: I am not getting any banner notices of arrival of new faxes. But I get the notices of successful fax delivery when I send one. Upgraded back to three stars when they allowed you to send a fax to several different fax numbers at once and they fixed the queue problem. But there is a new quirk in fax function: if you open a fax as a PDF in Doximity\, and then use 'Open in...' to move that PDF to another app (eg to add annotations as a reply)\, the second app cannot open it back into Doximity (eg to send the reply fax) unless you first go back to Doximity and click 'Done' to move out of the PDF reader.,US,2014-04-07 03:36:00,3,Palldoc,Quirks in fax function,393642611,
40004,Still unable to use app.  I guess I must have mis-spelled my email when I signed up\, because I never got an e-mail to verify my account.  When I sent a tech support request\, after a three day lag\, they told me to sign in on the website.  Which I cannot do\, because it needs my e- mail address. There needs to be a way to alternately verify ID so that you can access and reset your account details online\, or at least there needs to be enough support staff to assist in doing so in a timely manner.,US,2014-04-03 14:05:00,2,R.Tower,Needs better support,393642611,

40015,I was apprehensive about yet another app for physicians\, but this seems to have some true worth.

40016,I've attempted to register and this app around 15 times. I registered as a pharmacist and he keeps asking me to select my medical school. It doesn't even have any medical schools that can be selected. The registration stops at this point and won't let me go any further. This app is complete garbage.The concept of this app is great. However\, it doesn't function!,US,2013-10-04 14:52:00,2,Jmil29674,Doesn't work,393642611,
40017,When I first signed up on this App I was amazed at the number of physicians on file.  I was instantly updated with over half of my medical school class from 35 years ago.  I have enjoyed giving my personal fax number to labs and other sources when I want immediate access to the data\, like being on call on the weekend and I can then simply forward it to my office for filing. Saves me interrupting phone calls and scrambling to write down data.  I am about to begin using it with my residents and faxing them information about patients we are co managing.  This will save them multiple visits to my office to pick up printed records and reports. I am beginning to appreciate the subscription service to journal abstracts\, too.   Bravo on this App.,US,2013-09-18 17:10:00,5,bsdDr.,Great medical App!,393642611,

40021,A really useful app.  Getting colleagues numbers and fax numbers is easy. The fax is great it notifies you when one arrives. That way you don't have to waste time checking the fax if your expecting something important. As a radiologist without an office\, thats real nice. The only downside to the mobile app is you can't open the PDF's in another app like PDFpen so you can fill out and sign forms. You can from the web site with a lap/desk top. You also can't take a PDF from another app and fax it. With a few tweaks it will make paperless a reality on the go.,US,2013-09-03 20:16:00,4,MacRadDoc,Useful app,393642611,

40101,Wonderful appMakes communication between colleagues  easier : one of the weak links in our medical systemWould recommend this app to all medical providers to enhance communication between colleagues and with your pa and nps.Hope the 'find md' function will be improved in the future by making it more like putting info in your iphone contacts : not having to use capital letters and have multiple results  show up when you search rather than not found.,US,2012-11-22 10:14:00,4,Pswier,Md,393642611,
40102,Whether this application will develop remains to be seen.  Development will require physicians to sign up\, which is a bit spotty at the moment.However\, it has one nice feature\, the office land line numbers and fax numbers of apparently every practicing physician in the United States.  While probably not too important for most physicians\, for forensic pathologists in private practice this is super.,US,2012-11-06 14:39:00,5,Rkwrightmd,Nice application,393642611,

40113,I liked the easy to use older version better.  I don't love the layout now\, the app crashes often\, and I find it to be less user friendly than before.

40138,This app is just the type of thing that should exist.  I'm a big fan of the search function - e.g.\, search 'chinese orthopedic surgeon' and I get helpful results for referring patients.  Having that type of power on my phone is just what I would hope for these days.  Secure text messaging is a nice plus too.,US,2011-06-17 18:49:00,4,taketheatrain,Big Fan,393642611,
40139,I like what I see so far. There is great potential for this app to improve my workflow. So far my colleagues and I have been using  the 'DocText' feature to cut out some wasted communication time during the day. The pharmacy locator has proven to be a great asset--my patients have particularly been enjoying the map visuals.,US,2011-06-15 18:17:00,5,SportsSurg,Time Saver,393642611,

40142,Great app and great overall concept. It's made finding and connecting with other area MDs easier for me. And the pharmacy finder (especially the 24hr pharmacy location feature) has come in handy a number of times. Also\, I'm really curious what's hiding behind this mysterious 'Labs' feature...,US,2011-05-31 00:46:00,5,FamilyDoc75,Very cool MD networking app,393642611,
40143,Not sure what the utility of this app is. I can already find the closest pharmacy with google maps. Not sure when I would need the office number of the surgery department of some remote hospital. Faxing from my phone? Can't think of an instance where that would be useful. Its not even an EMR?,US,2011-05-22 02:39:00,1,Ssmd19,Physician,393642611,
40144,This is the worst physician app ever.  Why would I ever need to fax anything from my phone\, why wouldn't I just email someone\, let alone a note to a colleague?  This is a big waste of time to download.,US,2011-05-22 02:32:00,1,Dr Vin,IM doctor,393642611,

40146,they didnt used to support people who were trained internationally\, but I got notice that now they do\, and now i find it very helpful to connect with old classmates and find referring physicians to expand my network.  plus\, the additional languages is helpful\, hopefully they add insurers accepted.,US,2011-04-19 18:33:00,4,SJamesMD,good for foreign trained mds,393642611,
40147,This app is awesome. I found a bunch of old friends from my medical school in India who are now practicing here in the U.S.\, and one of them has an office just a few miles from me. We're meeting for lunch this week. Can't wait.,US,2011-04-18 22:27:00,5,doktrdan,My classmates from India,393642611,
40148,This app has enabled me to reconnect with some old friends from my alma mater -- something I probably wouldn't have done otherwise. The ability to send image attachments securely is an excellent addition to an already great app. Looking forward to more improvements.,US,2010-11-13 01:46:00,5,MDSign,Nice new feature,393642611,
40149,I've been using this app for a while\, and this version is yet another improvement. It looks like they've added the ability to send pictures along with instant messages. It's fun to see all my medical school buddies showing up as little pins on a map of the U.S.\, and I can contact them to find out what they're up to (and what they look like now).,US,2010-11-12 21:18:00,4,NB_Froggie,Keeps getting better,393642611,

40151,I always love it when\, in the age of rampant technological growth\, products are released which seem streamlined to you and your needs.  I have been unable to partake in the hoopla surrounding many of the social networking applications because I have not felt secure sharing my private information to the general public and because I have not felt the existing social networks are suited to help me and my business.  I love the functionalities of this application.  From being able to find old classmates from med school and residency\, or finding colleagues in my area\, to being able to securely share my private information and securely communicate with them\, this application stands out among the plethora of other\, less useful products.,US,2010-11-11 19:58:00,5,Dr. Dudovitz,Great For the Medical Community,393642611,
40152,I can connect to any medical professional in the county and search for pharmacies and facilities. What's really great is that it can scan my address book to find people I know\, I don't even need to look them up.I can even send secured messages to people with a photo of me - how cool is that?!,US,2010-11-11 19:30:00,5,dcdo,A tool every medical professional should access.,393642611,

40154,Love the app -- very useful and fun to find old colleagues. I did 'invite colleagues' and it sent them faxes.  I complained about no fax warning.

40156,BEWARE.  If you add people to the list it will send them a FAX with your message on it.  It does this without asking.  I know have 200 colleagues who think I'm an idiot.

42290,$75 a year for this!  Get real.  There are equal apps (like Beesy) for reasonable prices.This is only available in an iPhone version so it gives you that weird portrait screen on the iPad.It's an OK app but there are better things out there at a MUCH lower price.,US,2014-07-05 13:20:00,1,RedSpyderX,Unrealistic pricing,673688838,

45550,This app has cool emoticons BUT they don't upload to your keyboard to let you easily use them in a text or a Facebook post. You have to go to the app\, select the picture then ask to share it with your text behind it.

48857,I've tried several of these valet apps and Zirx is by far the worst. Eta always says 13 min but car takes 45 min to get your car back. Vatler and Luxe are much better.,US,2014-12-19 08:08:00,1,cmoney8,Terrible service,888526696,
48858,Love the service. Cost-effective and simple to use. I like that they are trying out little twists as well\, like filling up gas and washing your car. Definite recommend.,US,2014-12-17 23:31:00,5,eze75,Great App,888526696,
48859,Tried both Luxe and ZIRX in SF\, and hands down ZIRX puts Luxe to shame. Keep up the good work--> You guys are killing it.,US,2014-12-17 11:04:00,5,DownSouthBarber,ThatTechDude007,888526696,
48860,Tried the ZIRX app 1st time today\, oh boy it's pretty sweet! In downtown SF parking whole day for only $15? Drop off and pick up your car at any location? They even waive the $15 today for me because I wait 10 mins for the drop off (in a rainy day at the rush hour\, I totally think it's a reasonable wait time). Plus a cool bottle of water on car when u pick up. This is a commuter dream and one the best service design UX! Highly recommended for anyone need full day parking in downtown SF. Hope they can survive and grow.,US,2014-12-16 06:37:00,5,Albert Wang,Commuter's dream come true!,888526696,

48862,I tried Zirx for the first time today and the experience was great\, as was information presented by the app. Unfortunately this app leaves on the gps even while backgrounded\, which is harsh on my battery life. This really needs to be fixed\, especially since you need the app to get your car back. I was also disappointed in that while it recognizes my JCB card\, I cannot add it as a payment method.,US,2014-12-11 03:50:00,3,William Reading,Service great\, killing my phone battery\, not so much,888526696,

48864,Parking in SF - nightmare. Not any more with this app. Within ten minutes of giving them my location\, a representative had turned up\, identified himself and taken my car away to park it. Several hours later I gave the app a different location where I wanted to collect the cat\, ten minutes later it arrived in perfect condition with a bonus bottle of drinking water. Will be making a lot of use of this app\, only suggestion is to make the operating times (ie latest return) clearer on the app.,US,2014-11-22 05:39:00,5,Td2981,Game-changer,888526696,

48871,I just used zirx for the first time today and I was so pleased with the service. Instead of looking for parking\, an agent met me at my pick up point and parked my car for me. At the end of the day I was at a different location and the same agent brought my car again. They respond to my texts right away. I texted the guy my exact location so that there wouldn't be any confusion. I love this service! For $15 it was so worth it.I wish they would cover more areas soon.,US,2014-09-15 03:59:00,5,olivia7979,Rockstar parking,888526696,

48876,I tried this service today in Soma\, SF.It took 3 minutes to valet guy to appear. I saw his current location and his pic on the app's map was moving towards my location.It was fun.

52047,Что за сволочизм! Заставляют обновить версию приложения\, а пользоваться на iPad (первого поколения) в этой версии уже нельзя. Это же монопольный сговор с целью выкачивания денег из потребителя! По судам бы затаскать этих гнид\, вытрясти все их гнилое нутро и растоптать. Мерзавцы! А рецензия на приложение такая: Mail.ru — еще одна дерьмовая контора\, которая думает только о том\, чтобы выкачать бабло из клиента-ушастого. Никакой настоящей заботы о потребителе их продукта — только рекламные бла-бла-бла. И так у них на всех направлениях: почта — рассадник вирусов и спама\, хэдхантер — только спам и никакой эффективности\, разные сайты порно-знакомств и обсуждать не хочется.

Нужно самому в настройках выключить автозагрузку\, затем включить\, и только потом фото определяются и начинают подгружаться. Спасибо за подаренный 1тб\, благодаря этому перешел с dropbox\, но из-за проблем с автозагрузкой думаю не вернуться ли назад.

Нет приложения – нет и проблемы. Во-вторых\, неужели так трудно пошевелить мозгами и предположить\, что iPad-версия находится в разработке\, ибо так поступают практически все акулы бизнеса: сперва iPhone\, потом iPad. В-третьх\, если уж так у вас всё бурлит от возмущения\, неужели нельзя просто найти блог разработчиков (ведь нынче такие блоги есть у любых IT-компаний)\, хелпдеск\, ЧаВо или форум\, и прочитать там\, что таковая версия разрабатывается. В-четвёртых\, в приложении есть кнопка 'Написáть разработчику'. Спросите его\, ведь рука от нажимания кнопок не отсохнет. Здесь же почему-то не отсохла\, хотя вроде должна была.

55199,You have to pay for each thing like to get each thing unlocked separate charge\, remove adds another charge\, before I started paying all the charges it worked really well\, now that I have payed for each thing separate\, I can't get it to work\, it shuts down right in the middle of your project. Loved the app but they need to get it together. And respond to there customers emails.,US,2014-12-27 09:55:00,1,Memom2w,Photo lasso,821022276,

55202,They 'update' the app and you have to pay $1.99 more to do what you previously bought the right to do.  Fine if you don't mind continuous charges and being re-traded\, but don't waste $1.99 now to use your own background / photo b/c you'll have to pay another $1.99 less than 30 days later like me.,US,2014-12-24 23:01:00,1,3624346,They'll keep making you pay $$$$,821022276,

55209,So many pop up adds and a huge water mark and it was slow and it didn't save and.... Well you get my point\, I would give it zero stars.,US,2014-11-30 05:56:00,1,Deleted it sooooooo fast,Get,821022276,

55211,Pop ups were ridiculous. I've had ads pop up in other apps before but this was continuous one after the other. I must have bounced from the app to safari like 10 times because I accidentally tapped on the app while working on the photo. Wasn't even worth my time. If the ads were spaced out I would have considered buying but nope. Horrible.,US,2014-11-22 12:37:00,1,RosieG9811,Deleted after 5 minutes,821022276,
55212,I could never actually get anything done as I kept being interrupted about every 2 seconds with a pop up ad\, several which you had to wait a minimum of 5 seconds to get out of. Cutting\, if done seriously\, takes time. Not possible in the free ap\, so don't bother. Check out the pro version or use a different ap.,US,2014-11-14 01:54:00,1,ladyjewell,Too many pop ups WAAAYYYY too often,821022276,
55213,You literally can not touch your screen with this app because if you do\, you will undoubtedly hit an advertisement... Expect ads every three seconds. If I could give this zero stars I actually would. One star is generous for this garbage app.,US,2014-11-12 19:12:00,1,Hskamhffg,This is garbage.,821022276,
55214,They are even going so far to have pop-up ads that are a video. You will be very frustrated when you try to work on a image and a video ad pops up and you have to wait to skip it.,US,2014-11-08 06:16:00,1,1234567890(?!,They must be desperate for money because they have so many ads,821022276,

55216,Overall the app is great\, it gave me exactly what I was looking for. Other than the fact an ad popped up every ten seconds (not exaggerating) and there's a HUGE watermark in the middle of the final product.,US,2014-11-04 04:00:00,3,❤DELANEY❤,Somethings to fix.,821022276,
55217,This app would've been much better if the watermark weren't\, I don't know\, HUGE?! It ruins the picture\, and is EXTREMELY tacky.,US,2014-10-29 03:09:00,1,Fluffythingie03071997,Watermark.....tsk tsk.....,821022276,

55226,This app is actually pretty good but every time u touch the screen an ad pops up! It makes it really hard to work with. Then when u touch the screen to make an adjustment a finish screen pops up! Which makes it really hard to make small adjustments.

72575,We have been using the free version for a while now. It gives you enough time to get to know the different games and it has been a huge success with my fourth grader (and certainly gotten the attention of my kindergartener).

72584,I love\, love\, love this app. I have not seen an app that I was willing to pay $30\, but this is it. I have 1st through 5 single player. It has each area of common core math to practice their skills. I wish the progress monitoring was better and it was reasonable enough that school districts could download for each grade.

72587,I expected lot more exercises in each topic\, there are not many questions to practice. They don't refresh the problem bank either. My daughter is bored with this app already\, and I now I am back to where I started. Very very disappointed not at all worth the $$$ they are charging. My worst spend in the App Store\, lesson learnt.,US,2014-10-02 23:53:00,1,Mihika Chechi,Below expectation,492885924,

72589,At first I thought $30 was a lot. But I have a 4yr old also that could use this app as she goes to school.  My son (who is in 4th grade) was having some trouble understanding. So far it is helping him to remember some things. The more he does it the more he   Starts to grasp the concept.,US,2014-10-02 22:52:00,4,Tc2500,Not to bad,492885924,
72590,This is a fantastic app. It is just my kid needed. I've been having him to extra math problems from a Sylvan Learning Center book that helped as well\, but with all the distractions of modern devices these days\, I'm happy to have found a way to keep him entertained and developing his math skills in a fun way. Not to mention the personalized tutoring a child receives with this particular app. You simply can't beat it!,US,2014-10-02 22:37:00,5,Drewkophsky,Excellent App!!!,492885924,

72597,My favorite part about this app is the ability to customize which numbers my 4th grader need to practice. So\, he can practice all multiplication facts for the number 6 at the same time. He feels successful after just a few drills.,US,2014-09-12 04:35:00,4,Hilly985,Customize the numbers,492885924,
72598,Over all this is a pretty good app.  However\, their were two things things that I wasn’t crazy about.  The first thing is that practice problems generate potential answers for kids to choose from.  I would prefer that kids be able to input the correct answers themselves.  The second thing is that after buying Grade 4\, I had to buy Grade 3 in order for my son to review multiplication facts for numbers 1-10.  This is something that should be included as a review with every grade.  The better your kid knows his/her multiplication facts the easier it will be for him/her moving forward.,US,2014-09-11 22:35:00,3,audiocritic2,Pretty good,492885924,

72612,My son started 'playing' Splash Math this summer and is entering 4th grade this fall.

72674,Bought the full version and I like the app very much...my daughter enjoys it too and I think it's a good way for her to practice and really pound the knowledge into her head on the weekends or on trips :-) I tried a bunch of different math apps and like this one the best. Yes\, the app is built on the freemium model but you truly get a lot of problems and a slew of reporting/tracking features for parents when you buy the full version. Recommended!,US,2013-12-02 14:03:00,5,Alejandro de Paris,Worth the Money,492885924,

72679,Great app - my son can't put it down. Worthy of 5 stars but the sound doesn't work with the iPad app. The sound works on the iPhone app. We've checked the sound level and everything. Hopefully there's an update soon. Otherwise great app!!!,US,2013-10-31 12:21:00,4,jesters04,Great!,492885924,
72680,Fantastic way of presenting questions for increased understanding. Not really autopilot learning as there is nothing that introduces new concepts included. The reward system is a bit lacking as well\, but we can get past that with our own system. Overall a good purchase.,US,2013-10-11 18:04:00,4,kasperwithak,Great except for lessons,492885924,
72681,It was good and really helpfull you pay $9.99  for full version worth it trust me,US,2013-10-08 00:35:00,4,Dh kalon,Ehh,492885924,
72682,My child really enjoyed the 3rd grade Splash Math\, but this one has let us down. I really don't like the fact that you can't choose how many questions to set for your child. If I have her practice rounding numbers\, it has her do 24 questions and it won't record her results unless she does all 24. I'd like it to be a little more customizable. I have her work on several areas in a day and 24 questions per area is just too much.I also like the layout better in the 3rd grade one. I don't mind the space/astronaut theme at all\, but the other layout was more user friendly to me. We've abandoned this program for math this year and are looking elsewhere.,US,2013-10-04 22:52:00,3,Tapho22,Needs Improvement,492885924,
72683,Good app overall but it deleted all my progress when I deleted another one of my player's progress.,US,2013-10-04 00:44:00,2,tzemach,ok,492885924,
72684,4th Grade Math is good…not great\, but good.The coursework is a bit more stringent and strict and there is less of a 'fun' aspect to it. Of course I am comparing it to other titles by StudyPad Inc. (2nd Grade Math) and in this one they have strayed a bit too far from their center.Specifically\, they app awards UFOs (instead of stars) to mark the achievement. The collected UFOs is currency that is used to play games within the app. The games are disturbing simplistic -a stark contrast from the app itself. There is a dress up game\, for example\, that let's 4th graders dress up avatars as rocks stars and princesses. So an app that is designed to make you smart is rewarding you by a dumb game like that?With that reward system being so flawed\, the app is reduced to a mere worksheet. They even call the assignments 'homework' which kids immediately associate with school. This is a far cry from the theme of the app (UFOs\, spaceships\, astronauts) and from the other titles by the StudyPad Inc.Having said that\, I like the app. It's good and useful and gives kids an alternative to Angry Birds and Temple Run. But it also keeps me busy thinking of rewards for them.,US,2013-09-29 12:18:00,3,Adil B.,Good work,492885924,
72685,This app allows additional practice for what is taught in the classroom. It has helped strengthen my daughter's math skills. It has a list of the core math and worksheets that coincide to that topic\, and allows you to assign those worksheets for each topic as homework. It also has a great tool\, a graph\, that shows you where your child is strong or weak\, allowing you to target specific areas they need help on. Based on the prices of math practice books at the bookstore\, the price for the full version is reasonable in my opinion.,US,2013-09-15 11:53:00,4,AlwaysLiv42Day,Great For Core Math Practice,492885924,

72727,Well the game is great and a fun game\, but u can only do a limited amount of problems each day.(20 problems)I mean seriously \, why should they limit the problems on a 'free' game.

72728,My daughter loves this app. I bought an in-app upgrade to get the 'Full' version as my son had upgraded to the 'Full' version of 2nd grade math. But despite paying $9.99 I ended up with only the 'Lite' version for 4th grade. No idea why one grade gives you 'Full' and one grade only gets you 'Lite'. I have contacted customer support and they have not even been able to answer a very basic question\, let alone offer any assistance with my problem. They can write a great app for kids\, but they can't seem to actually read an email and respond appropriately. Be very careful when you purchase upgrades\, you might not get what you think you are getting!,US,2013-03-27 12:34:00,4,alhj75,App is Great\, Customer Service is not,492885924,

72732,The concept is awesome and the spreadsheets are cool. I also enjoy being able to assign 'homework' and receive weekly updates on my child's progress.  I may not be looking in the correct place\, but actual short lessons/steps on how to work through the various problems would make this 5 star to me. The only 'lesson' you get is occasionally when your response is incorrect.,US,2013-03-20 21:55:00,3,HotelMogul,Lacking in actual lessons,492885924,

72743,I think it is a great tool. However it was deceiving at first because they say the App is free but you can only do 20 problems. You then need to purchase the full version to get the full benefits. I did purchase because \, my child has struggled and I needed a fun way to help learn and understand the math\, so for that it has been wonderful and I enjoy the program. I think that the honesty should come out from the beginning and not allow people to think they are getting this great tool.

72770,My son loves to play this\, much better than worksheets.  This has covered every topic in his fourth grade math class so far\, which i think is great.  Since he doesn't have a textbook that comes home\, this program allows me to see what he is learning\,  and allows me to help at home.  Highly recommend for fourth graders or 3rd graders to get an extra head start.  I also have the 1st grade splash math for my younger child and love it too.,US,2012-12-10 23:18:00,5,Love unword,Love it ... Great tool,492885924,
72771,This is a great app.  The 'scratch pad' is terrific.  The skills addressed are appropriate.  My only  complaint is that there is no 'reward system'.  My daughter is in 4th Grade and I want her working on these 4th Grade skills; however\, she keeps wanting to do the 3rd Grade Splash Math so she can play with the aquarium reward system.  It's not terrible for her to be keeping her past skills current BUT I'm hoping for a FUN / REWARDING way for her to study for her next test.  Maybe the developer can do a reward system like feed the aliens or dodge meteors or build a spaceship.....\, something interactive (like there 3rd Grade version).  Otherwise\, great app.,US,2012-10-02 02:43:00,4,Mom of Z & G,WISH THERE WAS A REWARD SYSTEM...,492885924,

72775,My daughter started using Splash Math at the end of 2nd grade.  Wish we had purchased earlier.  She went from basic in 2nd grade on the CST to advanced on the 3rd grade CST thanks to the practice in multiple forms with visual aides.  We are using the 4th grade app to practice for upcoming tests as the app mirrors her textbook.  Highly recommend!!,US,2012-09-09 20:59:00,5,Pi rate,Great resource for the price of a good cup of coffee,492885924,

72785,I had my daughter try this app out\, the free version\, before purchasing\, since it was on sale. We figured it must be awesome to be $5 even on sale. She likes other less expensive apps better\, like Marble Math. She disliked that when you get an answer incorrect\, you do not get another chance to answer it\, it just tells you the answer and moves on. As a parent\, I do not like this either. If you cannot look at the problem and figure out the correct answer\, it is not usually going to stay with you. Glad there was a free version to hey out effort purchasing\, so we could save our money.,US,2012-07-21 03:08:00,3,RachelRazzle,My ingoing 4th grader was not a fan,492885924,

72793,This is one of the most well thought out apps I've seen. I like that I can assign worksheets (hence developing responsibility and accountability) and I receive weekly emails to remind me to check in and review. The way the app presents the concepts in various ways enables the student to broaden the way they view the specific way(s) the answer can be determined. I also use the recommendations to reassign sheets AFTER I have spent one-on-one time with my son reviewing the concept where deficiencies have been identified. My son does not balk at using the app\, and the positive reinforcement is not over the top. Yes\, you do have to invest a SMALL amount of money in-app for some of the advanced modules (geometry\, algebra etc) but it is a wholly wise use of a few dollars. Math foundations are critical and this app is wildly successful as both a class work enhancement tool\,and summer skill maintenance and regression prevention tool.,US,2012-06-07 04:14:00,5,Wolfsky,Parent Review,492885924,

I have an iPod 5th with iOS 8 and just wanted something to call out with if I forgot my cellphone.  This might work well for some but it won't be a replacement for calling on a regular cellphone\, even at the vip level.

72947,Just found this app by accidentally clicking on some advertisement\, but it turns out to be a great app! Planning on replacing my regular phone service with this. The only reason this app is not getting 5 stars is because the name is misleading. It reads 'free phone calls' but\, although dirt cheap\, it's really not free.,US,2014-10-17 02:43:00,4,Ron Malinovski,Great app!,447997168,

72955,For some reason this app will not let you dial into conference calls let alone record them even at the highest audio setting. While the callback feature is the only way to dial effectively\, it's terribly expensive and you still can't record since you're using your own line and defeats the purpose. Worthless! I also tried to reach developer for support\, via email. It's supposedly 24/7 email support which of course is a lie.

73067,I thought this was going to be a great app free calls I live in a rural area lots of tall trees. They sometimes block my signal on my I phone.. Well turns out it's not free oh u might get 5-10 minutes but there's always a catch this app was great for a few minutes but when it starts asking for money forget it I'm already paying for everything u can get on an iPhone  so I'm sure as hell not paying for another phone that would just make me stupid n I'm not so see ya 'free phone calls' !!!!!!!!!i had to rate it or I couldn't write my review and giving it 1 star is being generous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,US,2014-09-05 00:40:00,1,The Ma!,False advertisement,447997168,

73095,It's really neat. The bad part is you can only make calls when in wifi\, and I don't think people can call you back. What I was thinking is they should have an update where people can call you\, and after that\, make it where they show an alert about it when somebody is calling you. Also do it without wifi. But overall it is good. I went to my friend's house\, connected to wifi\,and called my house.,US,2014-08-24 03:20:00,4,StarPuck#1,Awesome!! now I got a giant Iphone.,447997168,

73099,it's a really cool app\, it's very unique in its own way and you can even call people from different country's. Most apps don't let you\, but this one is one of the best apps I have ever seen to call. the only thing that would make it perfect is if it had texting in it too\, because sometimes you don't want to talk or u have siblings asleep. So u can just text through it. But overall it's really cool. Give it a chance and I think you'll like it ☺️!,US,2014-08-22 02:42:00,5,Sophie ✌️,Really cool,447997168,

73244,I got this app while I traveled out of the US and I liked that it allowed me to make called over wifi. I also liked that I could buy credits through my iTunes account rather than setting up a new account for the app and adding a credit card on another website\, which was a plus for me. After calling a few friends and family I really liked this app and the rate per minute is really cheap and the call quality is great (depending on your wifi). One thing that I ran into was that I couldn't paste a number into the number field that I had just copied from a webpage\, and while that isn't a big deal it would be really handy for numbers you get via text or email. My biggest problem was that when I tried to call my bank\, I found out that this app doesn't allow me to input numbers during a call. This is really problematic when you try to input your account info on any automated call with a major company. This was really confusing since the app has an option to input numbers similar to the iPhone's layout but it just doesn't work.Over all I like the app for its good quality calls and great rates\, but the fact that I am going to have to buy a calling card just to call my bank is why this app isn't getting 5 or even 4 stars. Once this is fixed the app will be great and I'll use it every time I'm traveling.,US,2014-07-16 01:45:00,3,Santiago Bahti,Works well but needs some features,447997168,

If my math is right and you divide that bike to it comes to approximately $.13 a minute one way. I have tried to contact their customer service with no response.

73764,Perfect for when you need tech support on your phone and have to call from another one...who HAS another one.  I'm going to try to call out of the country tonight\, but so far in-country I give it 5 stars.UPDATE: I make phone calls to Mexico all the time and I have never used an internet phone where the sound is as clear as this. The rates are way cheaper than having to buy phone cards and honestly\, I think the sound is better than when using a phone card. The only thing that could make this app better would be the ability to receive calls as well. For now\, I'll take it as it is\, and as it is\, it still deserves all five of these stars. Great job to the developer.,US,2014-01-26 20:47:00,5,Joy5119,Perfect,447997168,

You can even have it display your own number when you calling some.  The cost is crazy cheep!  .01 one cent per minute.  Pay as you go if you need it use it if you don't don't!  Doesn't get any simpler than that. 5 star all way because this is exactly what I was looking for.

74409,I had high hopes for this app looking at all the flashy component. But I was wrong! Use Rebtel - Much better product than this app.I tried making two calls to Bangladesh using your Gold and VIP plans and the party on the other side couldn't even hear me properly. While your bells and whistles in your app looks very nice and flashy\, but I feel like you guys missed the main point here - communication. Your app is not working for me at all. Wish you guys had less flash and more focus on the connection. Like I said\, nice looking app though.,US,2013-10-26 13:54:00,1,Khan Hannan,All flash ..

I'm not even how much is even usable now. Whats worse is that i bought $15 in airtime beforehand! There was also a 5-8 second delay between when I spoke and when he actually heard me.

74861,Rates are great\, recording quality good\, I could open calendar (multitask) & call still recorded.  I've used it twice to test it out & liked it enough that I bought $5.00 more credits.

74879,A consultant I support at work wanted to listen to an audiocast offered through an agency giving CEUs but did not offer recordings of the audiocast and my consultant had client meetings that conflicted so I searched for a solution through the Apps Store on my iPhone. With just minutes to spare before the call started\, I was able to download the app\, call the number and begin recording. The call was an hour and a half long. After it was over I downloaded iTunes on my work computer\, transferred the file and Presto! my recorded audiocast is available at my consultant's convenience.

74907,the great thing about this app is the sound quality during the call.. i tested it on my 4Mbps internet and it was crystal clear!!the slight downturn is the cost: it's averaged at 80% off regular rates. so some apps are still offering calls for slightly cheaper. it all depends how long u spend talking on the phone every day!!bottom line: a must have app.. you'll most def need it!,US,2012-08-29 02:06:00,5,AbeTheKing,specially if you're a foreign student/employee,447997168,

74950,This app seems tempermental. When I first tried to make a call\, the app crashed. I eventually was able to get calls through but then the app started crashing again. Now the app is working again. Moreover\, although all buttons are visible to VoiceOver\, one must double -tap what looks like a text box at the top of the screen to access the keypad which is an annoyance. Furthermore\, once a call is in progress\, one can't make the keyboard visible to VoiceOver so a blind person can't enter more numbers as one must to use many automated phone services. Until these glitches are fixed\, I wouldn't recommend this app\, at least for use by the blind.,US,2012-08-10 21:37:00,1,Renaissance Guy,Good idea but short on execution!,447997168,

74988,This has been my main app for making VoIP calls for the past few months. Quality is always great on the other end; I can hear a few noise artifacts but over all the connection is as good or better than my cell. Does not always respond well if I am moving around but maybe more related to my wifi. Rates are outstanding. The only thing to make this app 5 stars would be the ability to have a number for people to call like google voice. Thanks for an amazing app!!

Easy to add credits through the app. This will save you loads of money!!,US,2012-02-26 06:06:00,5,Bennybouy,Absofruitly fantastic,447997168,
75048,I haven't used the app yet\, but saw all the bad reviews & wanted to help clarify: there ARE apps that you can get free minutes by watching videos (& for person who asked\, just look up 'free phone calls' in app store)\, BUT you have to have a wifi connection usually. When I tried using an app like this to call my son's school to tell them I'd be late\, I was @ our local mall\, & even though they have wifi there\, the signal quality is terrible & the school couldn't even hear what I was telling them. So\, an app like this is priceless for someone that: 1) Can't afford the high cell phone bills\, 2) has an iPod\, or 3) has kids they don't want to have to get phones AND an iPod for when one will suffice & be much cheaper than adding an extra phone to the already exorbitant iPhone cell bills! I think it's a great bargain. I'm a little disappointed @ hearing people say they're being charged when no one's even answering their call\, but otherwise seems like a great deal. For those w/the aforementioned complaint\, if you go to the app in the AppStore & go all the way to the bottom of the description\, there's a button to click for feedback that goes to the developer. Hope all this helps!,US,2012-02-22 19:17:00,5,angidazee,What everyone is missing...,447997168,

75180,Slow to load\, too many advertisements that take time to load.   It takes 5 min for the app to realize there is a newer edition.  Feels like 1995 technology,US,2014-12-30 03:37:00,1,AWESOMEman5200,A great read\, but the app performance is terrible,364387007,

75184,This app is poor in the following ways:- constantly crashes- will frequently not load (white page\, spinning icon)- runs a fully charged battery to zero in less than an hour as it will constantly try to load- article will load only the first image and no content; exiting and coming back might load itWould be great if WSJ could spend some capital and deliver a lighter app that didnt kill my device.  I rely on the web version as this is nearly worthless.---Dec 29\, 2014 update:I will continue to update this review on each release.  The content of WSJ is world class.  This mobile app\, however\, continues to be trash in the following ways:- Frequent crashes- clicking on an article will bring up the headline/by-line and one advertisement\, but no content- article will refresh seconds after loading\, causing you to wait to finish\, and it will being you back to the top\, losing your place- section\, such as Tech or Business\, will spin trying to load articles and will also frequently refresh will browsingI do not use this app for streaming quotes\, video or more sophisticated features.  I only want the articles.  WSJ\, please lighten the footprint/resources/'features' of this app to make it stable.,US,2014-12-30 00:44:00,1,morph_iggy,Slow\, buggy\, poor...the exact opposite of the content,364387007,
75185,I'm a WSJ online subscriber and enjoy the easy and simple method to review articles from the printed paper on my iPhone.  But\, the last major update requires me to wait a minute or two before it refreshes. I try to pull down from the top (inside the app)\, forcing it to refresh\, but it doesn't update immediately.,US,2014-12-30 00:42:00,3,Tone504,Great articles and clean layout\, but...,364387007,
75186,I was very cautious about purchasing this WSJ app because of all of the bad reviews. However I have not experienced any of the difficulties that the negative reviews are reporting. I been 100% satisfied with it!,US,2014-12-30 00:38:00,5,Jls925jerem,Works great for me,364387007,
75187,As a long time reader of the paper edition of the WSJ I am disappointed with this app. I have used it for a couple of years and seen the changes made over that time.  It was better when it was simple. Like other reviewers I too experience wait times for the content to refresh or reload while in the middle of reading an article. How many bad reviews do you need to read WSJ management before you will do something about this app? Your articles and opinion section are the best in the business. Who does your mobile app work?  The same programmers who designed the God awful state websites for Obamacare? You are not meeting my expectations nor those of other readers. All of us are paying good money for your content. Put your heads together and get this app working properly!,US,2014-12-30 00:25:00,2,DavidA5,Great Content...App Is Marginal at Best,364387007,
75188,Read the negative reviews but for me overall the app is easy to use and it is easy to navigate to the articles you want to read.  The digital version is great because the paper version doesn't pile up and that keeps my wife happy.,US,2014-12-30 00:05:00,4,alpha figmo alpha,No problem with the App,364387007,
75189,So slow!  Newspapers and technology is not a good mix. I frequently try to load the latest edition before I get on a flight. Always seems to be a problem. Tried to cancel my subscription and the instructions require you to call. I set it up on line but to cancel you need to call. How weird\, or not weird\, is that?,US,2014-12-29 22:01:00,1,Tamperjoe,Content is good App is not,364387007,
75190,The iPhone app is missing the date and time of the article. You never know if you are looking at the latest version. It is an oversize that is not acceptable for someone like me that travels to different time zones.  Please correct immediately.  In the iPad version it is very clear.,US,2014-12-29 20:45:00,2,David Gibellini,No date no time,364387007,

75194,Ive been reading the WSJ Daily since I got my first Ipad in 2010.  Great content\, but the app continues to get worse with each update.  My biggest problem with this update is that i tend to download and read offline on the plane.  This new app only grabs about half. Plus\, crashing is atrocious on older ipads. I have now upgraded ipads twice simply because new updates made it so unstable. Works great on Air 2....for now.,US,2014-12-29 19:58:00,3,Bkbroiler74,Content great\, but app gets worse each update,364387007,

75196,One star may be unusually harsh\, but this is the only instant I ever found anywhere in the iTunes Store where an app removed a significant part of the reason why I used it (in this case\, the Market Data Center)\, without warning or explanation. I am on the verge of canceling my entire WSJ subscription over it.,US,2014-12-29 18:32:00,1,Hernan Lopez,Went backwards,364387007,
75197,This app is so much worse than the New York Times.  It fails to load all the time. You get hit with one page ads\, that are slow to load. It does not update throughout the day.   The app also crashes all the time.   A complete makeover is in order,US,2014-12-29 17:45:00,1,Erlend Bo,Awful app,364387007,
75198,Still buggy and unpredictable. Reading web edition instead. Hate it being in newsstand. Crashes often\, fails to update\, and misbehaves in other ways. Does WSJ do any testing at all?

75200,Too many graphics.  It crashes constantly.  Please offer a basic app so I can just read the newspaper without the crashing.  I would give zero stars but it will not let me.,US,2014-12-29 16:20:00,1,GyroMania,Crashes constantly,364387007,

75202,This app is inferior.  It takes forever to load.  It actually never seems to finish loading.  The app seems to be all about full page adds with the interests of the paying subscriber coming last.Why not let us know how much of your daily newspaper has loaded?Each update is poor.Dow Jones ignores its readers.  It's all about the advertisers.This is my most recent review. Last time I wrote. This is the third time I have posted a review after loading WSJ update. This version is as bad as the prior versions. The app simply does not load. There is no status bar to see if anything is happening. It is terrible the WSJ keeps putting out an app that won't loadLast time I wrote:Recently installed update and now the app crashes all the time.Both iPhone and iPad versions load very slowly.  The 'Today' and 'Now' versions double the slowness as the app constantly updates both.Terrible app for a company like Dow Jones.Today app won't start on iPad.  Had to delete app and download.This app is awful and reflects poorly on Apple and Dow Jones,US,2014-12-29 14:26:00,1,Usermetoo,Never completes loading,364387007,

75205,The new wsj app is far inferior to the old app. Difficult to navigate. And not connected to other parts of the paper.  A simple opportunity is to share alerts to connect directly to the app for viewing and does not do that.  Simply far inferior to the FT new app. And below expectations for the wsj.  A disappointment,US,2014-12-29 14:06:00,1,LisaRTribeca,Wsj app,364387007,
75206,It is improved but takes too long to download compared to the NY Times.

75208,The papers writing\, content\, and layout are world class. The app however is frustratingly disappointing. Fresh content doesn't load automatically when the app hasn't been accessed for more than a day. The app will then refresh while reading an article requiring the reader to search for the place where the reader left off. Or worse\, to search for the article itself. Oddly\, I maintain my e-subscription so I can access the Journal on my desktop which is counter to my reason to have efficient mobile access.,US,2014-12-29 13:30:00,2,Mlkol,Excellent Content\, Unstable App,364387007,

75211,The latest upgrade since iOS 8 is virtually unusable! Takes too long to update articles\, often the app hangs and articles can't get updated\, feels very clunky.

75212,This app continues to be horrible. Instead of starting at today's edition it stays on the last one I was reading. I have to back track to get to today's. Also\, where did the 'now' edition go with most up to date news???  WSJ\, get your act together already.,US,2014-12-29 13:00:00,1,tsimmes,Abysmal app,364387007,

75214,Hi\, I use the WSJ app daily\, not because it is great\, but because I like the WSJ.It crashes a lot. Maybe 5 to 10 times while reading a single edition. It restarts to where you leave off\, but very annoying.My other issue is that some\, or rarely all\, may download for off line reading\, like on a plane. There is no way to know\, until you try to read an article\, and it isn't there.,US,2014-12-29 12:29:00,2,Bill4Prez,WSJ app crashes a lot,364387007,
75215,I prefer the previous format which was more like reading the print version. Now when I read the digital version I feel like I am missing half of the articles.,US,2014-12-29 12:14:00,2,Longbd51,Prefer the previous format,364387007,
75216,Great content\, obviously.  iPhone version is fine\, but iPad version has degraded. Placing an ad between each full screen is awful\, load time is too long\, navigation has become harder\, and the start screen doesn't work consistently to allow access to previous days.

75218,I prefer the WSJ app over the website. I find it easy to read and its a similar experience to flipping through a paper. Just be sure to click on the drop down menu for each section because there are additional stories available to read.,US,2014-12-29 11:54:00,4,kw0480,Enjoy & prefer over website,364387007,

75224,The app used to deliver the new edition about midnight (eastern)\, but now it is considerably later.  The app used to mirror the print edition with the 'index' in the left margin\, which made it easy to select the stories I wanted to read.  Furthermore\, I do get and read the print issue\, so I do get the ads and don't have to wait for them to download. You have once again proven that change is not always progress!  Please return us to the template that you used to use!,US,2014-12-29 04:45:00,1,Donald Nelsch,Slow delivery and hard to navigate,364387007,

75228,Content great\, App nearly unusable due to near constant Update attempts. Blanks the screen you are reading\, then hangs with screen unreadable for minutes at a time\, if it does return it throws you to beginning of article so you lose your place. No ability to control updates\, so even if you try to preload content\, it will hang trying to refresh a few minutes later. Why not let user decide when to do updates? Also weird UI -- eg no landscape mode and Home key doesn't take you home.,US,2014-12-29 02:52:00,1,gggg7277756,Stick with Paper,364387007,
75229,Until the WSJ offers continuous scrolling for articles within their app it will remain inferior to the NYT app.,US,2014-12-29 02:46:00,3,ozz77,Better but no continuous scrolling = awful,364387007,
75230,This app had some real growing pains\, but the latest version is working pretty well. Performance is good. The full-page ads in the middle of stories don't load quickly. Fortunately the app just lets you skip right by.,US,2014-12-29 02:43:00,5,HighlandSteve,Improved,364387007,
75231,Truly a case of two steps forward two steps back.  It's more stable now but\, much much worse to navigate.  In the latest version\, the links to go between the sections of the paper in the drop down are gone.  So\, now you have to go back to the front page to switch between sections.,US,2014-12-29 02:36:00,1,Joe from Highland Park,Better\, but navigation much worse,364387007,
75232,The latest update has less glitches and runs much faster.  Still slow to transition from email summaries and almost always requires logon again before reading selected article each time.,US,2014-12-29 01:25:00,4,Dinozza,Getting better,364387007,

75235,Enjoy the content. Do not enjoy the article resetting while I'm reading it. And the iPad version is worse since it resets to show an ad mid-read. The app is going backward instead of improving over time.,US,2014-12-28 20:48:00,3,Revto9k,WSJ App,364387007,
75236,The #1 reason I read the NYTimes several times a day and the WSJ about twice a week is because the WSJ's app is so\, so terrible. That's just a shame.,US,2014-12-28 20:04:00,1,Dealguy,It's just an awful app,364387007,
75237,I'm not experiencing the buggy/crashing problems the many describe. I agree the in-article ads are a nuisance with slow load times so I just skip past. Choosing issues is similar with other papers so it is not much of annoyance though an automatic download would be nice. Small quirks are worth it is the content is great as always.,US,2014-12-28 17:33:00,4,5shamrocks,Content is great .. Interface ok and stable enough,364387007,
75238,I am a digital subscriber and enjoy the great content on the WSJ website. There was a time\, many moons ago\, when the iPhone app mirrored the desktop site. Browsing through sections was intuitive and most important\, the app would update seamlessly...Not anymore. The latest version of the app is frustrating to use. Content gets updated infrequently (despite turning on Background refresh) and when it does\, the app crashes. And crashes. And crashes... I often found myself re-setting my profile to get the app to update.  I have since deleted the app and created a direct link to the WSJ mobile site on my phone. It's clunkier but at least it's updating. It is a shame that a company like Dow Jones cannot develop a better app. Avoid for now.,US,2014-12-28 17:05:00,1,DarkHorse0928,No worth it at this time,364387007,

75242,I truly enjoy reading the WSJ.  It is my daily newspaper and content is top.   The app is improving - thanks - but still upside in terms of simplification and crash.,US,2014-12-28 15:26:00,4,EmmanuelCargill,Improving,364387007,
75243,Love this app! I travel and miss the paper. This keeps me informed. Easy and convenient.,US,2014-12-28 15:07:00,5,CNestle,Great,364387007,
75244,The newest update to the worst update in history  is a little better\, but why not use NY Times as a guide (no I am not associated with them). Swiping left or right for the index is so awkward to go to the next article. Expanding the page is so much easier.  The content is nice\, but finding it is really hard. Thought about just canceling so many times but just keep hoping.,US,2014-12-28 15:03:00,2,retailbna,Updated app,364387007,
75245,There is plenty of criticism on many of these reviews\, but coming from a college student at the #1 IB school in the nation\, this app is great. It is a lot easier to use than trying to flip through the WSJ hard-copy newspaper and very easy to save charts/graphs as well as interesting articles.,US,2014-12-28 14:54:00,5,Darla Moore Business Student,Great App,364387007,
75246,I've used the app daily for over a year. Generally works smoothly\, if a little sluggish at times. But that could be my iPad2 jammed full. Getting daily issues within 30 seconds is nothing to complain about\, considering the alternatives. The complaints in harsher reviews have some basis in fact\, but seem to be written in the heat of frustration. Yes\, for a subscription based app\, it should be way smoother\, but it hasn't been annoying enough to drop it. It gives me up to date info in a way that is easy to navigate. And when the programmer-du-jour decides to muck up the interface again\, I just deal with it and figure it out. It's news folks\, not a 911 call center. If you like WSJ content\, you'll like this he app.,US,2014-12-28 14:41:00,4,Print Doctor,Happy enough,364387007,
75247,Updates should improve the experience. For the WSJ app\, it takes steps back.   One of the brat features of the WSJ is a focus on delivering business news efficiently to busy readers.  This new version fails at delivering that.  It does not open the current edition automatically\, I have no idea where market data has moved to and everything seems to move slower.,US,2014-12-28 14:21:00,2,One forward two steps back,I miss the original version,364387007,
75248,As others have reported\, this app continues to get worse and worse.This is not a free news service - people pay over $200 per YEAR for it.It should be far\, fare better.In the meantime WSJ should fire their programmers AND the management responsible.,US,2014-12-28 14:02:00,1,JLdog,App is garbage - cancelled sub,364387007,
75249,I enjoy reading the WSJ and find the app OK. I don't have any experience with other online newspaper apps so can't compare it.,US,2014-12-28 10:58:00,4,KiwiSam5,Great reading,364387007,
75250,Terrible performer.Slow to load - constant refresh mid-article brings you back to beginning or menu and sometimes app simply shuts down.Only on iPhone - not on iPad. I primarily use my phone.For the money - not worth it.,US,2014-12-28 10:00:00,1,iVato,constant refresh mid article,364387007,
75251,Content is really good\, delivery needs urgent improvement! Why can't it open in latest news? Articles take a long time to load. Advertisement interrupts article reading on paid subscription\, why can't ads be on the side or bottom of page without stopping the reading?,US,2014-12-28 09:17:00,1,Hidrocab,App needs urgent improvement,364387007,

75254,Since I started using this app I have seen continual improvements. The layout and quality of the content is excellent. I prefer it over the paper that is delivered to my door.,US,2014-12-28 06:27:00,4,Jim Gunlock,Excellent content and easy to use,364387007,
75255,Easy to use.,US,2014-12-28 05:39:00,5,Bird man ^2,Very nice.,364387007,

75257,Clunky\, buggy\, and too much advertising taking up screen space.,US,2014-12-28 04:21:00,1,Jbattisti,Clunky,364387007,
75258,I like to read the digital version on my iPad or my Surface 3.  I am retired and constantly on the go. The WSJ give me all the financial\, tech and world news I need no mater where I am in the USA.,US,2014-12-28 03:36:00,5,Proto Loco,Great way to read WSJ while away,364387007,
75259,This is a great news app for business people and anyone,US,2014-12-28 03:13:00,5,israelkay,Best news app,364387007,
75260,overall app design & architecture (business\, ux\, & tech) is horrible regardless of content. it's maddening. i'm close to canceling my subscription after trying for a couple months.,US,2014-12-28 03:09:00,1,Wildchicken,bad app design,364387007,
75261,I have been a WSJ electronic paper subscriber for at least six years.  For most of that time I could not imagine how WSJ could have such a poor performing and problem laden app. Then they changed the whole look and feel with this latest version.  I was prepared to drop my subscription.  BUT this is the best.  The problems seem to be gone.  The new format is very fluid and useful. The speed is enjoyable. Finally\, the app is one that I can highly recommend.,US,2014-12-28 03:04:00,5,Kelleygl,Newest Version Best Ever,364387007,
75262,I prefer to get my financial\, national and global business and other news that affects people and institutions from this reliable source.  It helps me to think strategically with my clients and is a source of current information for my undergraduate students.Maurice PainterNashville\, TN,US,2014-12-28 02:15:00,4,MLP37027,Review of The Wall Street Journal,364387007,
75263,I had the WSJ app for the nook and now I have it for my IPad this is much more user is more like reading the actual paper I also have the Barons app and like it as we'll. BUTThere are some annoyances.  Sharing of an article or editorial leads the recipient to the need to subscribe in order to read the whole article.  Really?  If I had the paper I could cut out the article ads scan or fax it. I can print the article as a PDFS and send it as an attachment. The need to jump through hoops to share an article is just plain user unfriendly.  If you want limit the shares to a small number of articles per dayAlso\, if I open the app it takes me to the last article I was reading. If it's not the same day it should open today's paper without prompting,US,2014-12-28 01:09:00,3,GAB48227,Needs improvement,364387007,
75264,I am amazed at the incompetent programmers making this App. The editorials criticize the government for inefficiency yet the editorial board puts up with this lousy app? Areas that need immediate improvement:1. Even now no comments available to read or post.2. Order of articles in web version different to app.3. Frequent crashes.4.  Even though app sits in news stand\, you still have to wait for downloads.,US,2014-12-27 22:18:00,1,upnorth85,Each version is worse than before,364387007,
75265,I find the app very easy to navigate and use. I've been using it for a week now and absolutely love it. It's like carrying everyday's newspaper with you but without the bulk of the real papers.,US,2014-12-27 21:29:00,5,CasualAppleUser,Very easy to navigate and use,364387007,
75266,I agree with the typical review that gives this a mediocre rating.  The app only seems to access maybe 65% of WSJ total content and not very consistently at that.,US,2014-12-27 20:33:00,3,3blade,Mediocre,364387007,
75267,This is an excellent source of news and information on major issues affecting the USA. I like the way the important news is highlighted first. I miss market Data that was on the older version.,US,2014-12-27 20:07:00,5,JohnnyBobo,Wall Street Journal On line review.,364387007,
75268,Stop waiting until I've written my review to tell me my nickname is taken and then erasing my review!!! ,US,2014-12-27 19:51:00,2,Judith Ann Jacobs,Getting to current issue,364387007,
75269,The WSJ app was never the greatest--somewhat slow and bloated\, and prone to crashing more than just every once in a while. It has gotten worse over time. Gone is the one-tap access to the home page. Issues are no longer cached in a persistent state\, and\, all-around\, it is taking more clicks than ever to access stories\, swipe past the increasing number of ads\, and navigate between sections. Plus\, it's > $20 / month for the content. As others have written\, said content is great. But it is of diminishing value in light of the app's ongoing crapification.,US,2014-12-27 19:15:00,2,Todd Clifton,An App Moving Backwards,364387007,
75270,I read it every day. Love the columnists.,US,2014-12-27 18:52:00,5,gmacb,Great!,364387007,
75271,This app is getting worse with each release.  It takes forever to download on the new iPhone and my iPad app is intermittent at best.  NY times here I come.  The content isn't as good but at least it's a reliable news source.,US,2014-12-27 18:05:00,1,CKBXYZ,Downward trend,364387007,
75272,My time on my iPad is in the WSJ. I will admit\, I am addicted to the WSJ. A fix that would be BIG\, when you send an article to someone that you find interesting\, it will not let them read it unless they subscribe. This is not cool. I've been read WSJ for 20+ years and use the every day.,US,2014-12-27 17:43:00,5,CheriO'M,90% on the App,364387007,
